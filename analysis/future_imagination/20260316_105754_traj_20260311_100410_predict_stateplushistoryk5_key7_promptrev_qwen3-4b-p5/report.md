Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering with available terrain.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely explores the area around (1, -3) and (-5, 0), gathering wood from nearby trees and preparing for tool upgrades.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may find a way to craft a wooden pickaxe using available resources, enabling the transition from wood to stone tools.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player likely searches for the ladder to descend, potentially encountering mobs that may require combat or resource management.

Trajectory summary: The player's next steps involve exploring the map, gathering resources, and preparing for tool upgrades. The focus is on low-risk activities until the player can descend to the next floor, where more significant challenges and progression opportunities will arise.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first: drink water for thirst, eat animals for food, sleep in safe situations for energy)
   - resource progression (wood -> stone -> iron -> diamond tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the event list focused (typically 3-6 events) unless

Headline: Resource gathering and survival stabilization expected before floor progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving left towards the water and tree clusters to gather resources and stabilize intrinsics.
2. [t+9 to t+16] A threat may appear, forcing the player to fight it off while maintaining survival metrics.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player replenishes Food, Drink, and Energy to recover from the fight and prepare for further exploration.
4. [t+25 to t+32] The player moves left to gather remaining resources, upgrading tools from wood to stone as progress is made.

Trajectory summary: The player is expected to focus on resource gathering and survival stabilization before attempting floor progression. The timeline is likely to be extended by potential threats or resource scarcity, but the overall direction remains focused on preparation and gradual advancement.

Headline: Resource gathering and threat management will dominate the next phase.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving left to collect stone and prepare for tool upgrades, unless a threat appears.
2. [t+9 to t+16] A nearby threat may emerge, requiring the player to defend against it, which could drain intrinsics.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player will seek cows and water to replenish food and drink, stabilizing intrinsics after the threat.
4. [t+25] The player may attempt to upgrade tools from wood to stone, using collected resources to improve efficiency.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to focus on gathering resources and managing threats before advancing further. Stabilizing intrinsics and upgrading tools are key priorities, with potential interruptions from random encounters. The path is plausible but subject to uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of the game world.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering in a confined area.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely moves right along the path at (0,0) to explore the open area, gathering wood and stone as needed.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may find and use the stone pickaxe to mine stone, potentially encountering mobs that could disrupt progress.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player may seek the ladder at (3,3) to descend, but will need to manage food and energy levels if mobs are encountered.

Trajectory summary: The player is in a confined area with accessible resources and a ladder. The near future involves resource gathering and exploration, with a likely transition to descending once the ladder is confirmed safe. Progression is contingent on managing intrinsics and encountering mobs.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.

2. [t+9 to t+16] A mob may approach, forcing the player to fight it off using the iron sword.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player replenishes food, drink, and energy by finding cows and water to recover from the fight.
4. [t+25] The player upgrades tools from wood to stone by gathering remaining stone, preparing for progression. 

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to continue moving left toward stone resources before engaging in combat. If no major interruption occurs, the focus will shift to resource gathering and tool upgrades. Exact outcomes remain uncertain due to potential threats and random events.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource refinement before floor progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely moves right along the path at (0, -1) and (1, -1), encountering a snail at (4, -1), and may use the bow or arrows to deter it.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may gather wood from nearby trees or use the existing wood to craft better tools, possibly upgrading the pickaxe to a more efficient one.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player likely searches for the ladder on floor 1, possibly at (3, 2), and prepares to descend once the ladder is confirmed open, ensuring intrinsics are stable before progression.

Trajectory summary: The player's near future involves cautious exploration and resource refinement. If the ladder at (3, 2) is confirmed open and intrinsics remain stable, the player will likely descend to the next floor, marking the transition from resource gathering to meaningful progression.

Headline: Player likely continues descending toward the ladder, with resource gathering and threat management as key near-term priorities.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving down toward the ladder, navigating through darkness and walls, with the ladder remaining open as per current state.
2. [t+9 to t+16] The player may encounter mobs or environmental hazards, requiring combat or resource management to survive.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player likely focuses on gathering resources like stone and wood, upgrading tools and preparing for progression.
4. [t+25] The player may attempt to descend further, using the ladder to move to the next floor, assuming no major interruptions.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to continue descending toward the ladder, prioritizing resource gathering and threat management. The path is influenced by the current open ladder and the need to prepare for progression, though specific outcomes remain uncertain due to random encounters and map unpredictability.
