Headline: Securing resources and preparing for ladder descent on floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player gathers wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and improve survival readiness.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player searches for a crafting table to craft a stone pickaxe using gathered wood and stone.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With the stone pickaxe ready, the player begins mining stone and coal to advance toward ladder progression.

Trajectory summary: 
The next few moves focus on gathering essential resources to enable tool crafting and floor progression. Once basic tools are available, the player will shift toward mining and preparing for the ladder descent.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Initial exploration and ladder pursuit on floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the ladder at (0,0) and explores nearby trees for wood.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player likely crafts a wooden pickaxe using gathered wood and starts mining stone nearby.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With the pickaxe ready, the player begins to probe outward for the ladder and additional resources.

Trajectory summary: 
The next few moves focus on gathering wood and crafting a basic tool. Once the wooden pickaxe is ready, the player will start exploring further to find the ladder and other resources.

Headline: Proceeding toward the ladder while managing low food and preparing for potential upgrades.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right toward the ladder, avoiding the cow at (1, 0) and staying clear of potential threats.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player likely gathers more wood or stone to craft a better tool, given the current iron sword and low food.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With the ladder open, the player will prioritize taking it down, but may first check for nearby resources or a crafting table to upgrade further.

Trajectory summary: 
The player is in a safe area with an open ladder, so the immediate focus is on moving toward the ladder. Low food levels mean the player will need to gather more resources or kill animals before proceeding further down. Upgrades are likely to be considered once the ladder is the main priority.

Headline: Securing ladder access and resource upgrades on floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the ladder at (0, 0) and checks if it is open. Since it is closed, the player begins exploring nearby for resources and troops.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player gathers additional wood and stone, using the stone pickaxe to mine further, while looking for the ladder or troops to open it.
3. [t+12 to t+15] Once the ladder is open, the player uses it to descend to the next floor, prioritizing safe movement and resource gathering on the new floor.

Trajectory summary: 
The player's immediate focus is on opening the ladder on floor 1. With the ladder closed, the player will gather resources and clear troops to progress. Once the ladder is open, the player will descend to the next floor, continuing the progression down.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+6 to t+11] The player explores floor 2, looking for resources and the next ladder.
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player gathers wood and stone to craft better tools and prepare for potential threats.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder

Headline: Probing for ladder and resources on floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player continues moving left, likely seeking the ladder or resources in the path at -3, -4.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player may find the ladder open and use it to descend, or explore for coal, wood, and stone near the path at -3, -2.
3. [t+12 to t+15] If the ladder is used, the player will descend to the next floor. If not, they will continue gathering resources or preparing for the ladder.

Trajectory summary: 
The player is in a zone with potential for both ladder progression and resource gathering. If the ladder is found and used, the player will move to the next floor. If not, they will continue exploring for essential materials and prepare for the next phase of progression.
