Headline: Immediate resource acquisition and ladder descent on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the nearest trees (at -4, -3, -2) to gather wood, prioritizing survival and tool creation since the inventory is empty.
2. [t+6 to t+11] With wood secured, the player crafts a wooden pickaxe and sword, then begins mining nearby stone to prepare for the next tier of equipment.
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player descends the open ladder to Floor 1, as the primary goal of progression is now active and survival is stabilized by basic tools.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by rapid resource conversion and vertical progression. The player will quickly transition from a raw state to having basic wood/stone tools, then immediately descend to the next floor to continue the loop of gathering and fighting.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate wood gathering and tool crafting to enable stone mining on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the nearest tree at (2, -4) or (-2, -2) to gather wood, prioritizing resource acquisition since the inventory is empty and no tools exist.
2. [t+6 to t+11] With wood secured, the player crafts a wooden pickaxe and sword, then begins mining the adjacent stone tiles to progress toward the stone tier.
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player continues mining stone and likely crafts a stone pickaxe, while checking the ladder status; since it is already open, they may descend once stone tools are ready or continue gathering if stone is abundant.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by the initial resource-to-tool pipeline. The player will rapidly convert local trees into a wooden toolkit, transition to stone mining, and likely craft stone tools before the ladder descent becomes the primary focus, assuming no immediate hostile interruptions.

Headline: Immediate resource consolidation and ladder descent on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right toward the Cow at (1,0) to kill it, restoring Food, while gathering nearby Stone and Saplings to prepare for a crafting table.
2. [t+6 to t+11] With the Cow secured, the player crafts a Stone Pickaxe (if not already prioritized) and immediately locates the open ladder at the edge of the map to descend to Floor 1.
3. [t+12 to t+15] On the new floor, the player assesses the environment for the next ladder or immediate threats, maintaining high Health and Energy before engaging any new mobs.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by a quick survival boost from the Cow, followed by the critical progression step of descending the open ladder. The player will stabilize resources on Floor 0 before committing to the transition to Floor 1, where the ladder will likely be closed until 8 troops are killed.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition and ladder descent preparation.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right to engage the Cow at (1,0), killing it to raise Food from 2 to 3 and gain XP.
2. [t+4 to t+8] The player consumes the raw meat, restoring Food to 9, stabilizing the stat that was critically low, and likely gathering nearby stones to replenish inventory if needed.
3. [t+9 to t+15] With Food secured and the ladder already open, the player prioritizes descending to the next floor, leaving the current safe zone behind.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by correcting the low Food stat before progression. Once the Cow is killed and eaten, the player's survival metrics will be stable, allowing the primary goal to shift entirely to descending via the open ladder.

Headline: Immediate resource consolidation and ladder preparation on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right along the path at Row 0 to locate the chest at (5, 0) and gathers the loot, then turns left to collect the nearby stone wall blocks for crafting.
2. [t+6 to t+11] With sufficient stone and wood, the player crafts a Stone Pickaxe to replace the wooden one, enabling efficient mining of the stone walls found at (-4, -4) through (5, -4).
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player mines the stone wall at (-1, -4) to clear a path or gather more stone, while monitoring the ladder status; if the ladder remains closed, they continue killing any encountered troops to reach the 8-mob threshold.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by securing the chest loot and upgrading the pickaxe to stone, which is the critical bottleneck for future progression. Once the tool upgrade is complete, the player will focus entirely on clearing the stone wall corridor to the left to either find the ladder or kill the required number of mobs to open it.

Headline: Immediate survival stabilization and resource consolidation on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right toward the wall at (0,1) and places stone blocks to create a safe enclosure, prioritizing safety due to low Health (3.0) and the presence of a Snail at (-2,0).
2. [t+6 to t+11] Inside the enclosure, the player consumes the Green potion to heal, then sleeps to recover Energy and stabilize Health before any further movement.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With vitals restored, the player exits the enclosure, gathers the nearby Stone (19 available) and Wood (5 available), and crafts a Stone Sword to replace the current Iron Sword (which requires Stone to craft but is currently held; assuming the prompt implies upgrading *to* Stone if tools are missing, but here we have an Iron Sword. However, the algorithm says "If the player has no useful tools... gather wood... mine stone... craft stone pickaxe and stone sword." Since the player *has* an Iron Sword, they likely won't downgrade. *Correction based on strict algorithm interpretation*: The player has an Iron Sword. They need Stone Pickaxe. They will craft a Stone Pickaxe using the 19 Stone and 5 Wood (need more wood, but will gather). Actually, the player has 19 Stone. They can craft a Stone Pickaxe immediately. They will craft the Stone Pickaxe to mine Coal/Iron later.)

*Refined Event 3 based on inventory logic*: The player crafts a Stone Pickaxe using the gathered Stone and Wood to prepare for mining Coal and Iron, as the current toolset is insufficient for progression past basic resources.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by a "survive then stabilize" loop. The player must first secure a sleep spot to recover from low Health, then immediately transition into resource processing (crafting a Stone Pickaxe) to enable the mining of Coal and Iron, which are prerequisites for the next tier of equipment and ladder progression.

1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right to clear the immediate threat (Snail) and secure the stone at (1,0), likely killing the Snail to gain food and prevent health decay.
2. [t+6 to t+11] With the immediate threat neutralized, the player gathers the nearby stone at (1,0) and potentially mines the wall at (0,1) if accessible, increasing stone stockpile to ~22-24.
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player consolidates resources, checking for a crafting table or placing one if missing, while monitoring the Orc Mage's position to avoid engagement until the ladder priority shifts or survival is critical.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by low-risk survival and resource hoarding. The player will not attempt upgrades yet due to low health (3) and the need to secure food from the Snail encounter. Once the Snail is dealt with and stone is gathered, the player will likely look for a safe spot to sleep or craft basic tools, keeping the ladder hunt as a secondary goal until 8 troops are secured.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable

Headline: Immediate ladder descent and resource consolidation on Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right to coordinate (5, 3) and takes the open ladder to descend to Floor 2.
2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon landing, the player explores the immediate area, gathering the nearby sapling and stone while checking for the new descent ladder.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With survival stable and no immediate threat, the player uses the gathered sapling to craft a crafting table if one isn't nearby, preparing for future tool upgrades.

Trajectory summary:
The next few moves are dominated by vertical progression. The player will immediately leave Floor 1 to find the next ladder, then shift focus to securing basic resources (wood/stone) on the new floor to maintain a stable base for the upcoming descent.

Headline: Final floor clear and immediate descent to Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player continues moving right toward the open ladder at (0, 3), passing the nearby fountain and wall obstacles without stopping for upgrades.
2. [t+6 to t+10] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to Floor 2, triggering the reset of the kill counter for the new floor's ladder.
3. [t+11 to t+15] On Floor 2, the player immediately begins clearing the first few mobs (likely 2-4) to progress toward opening the next ladder, while managing energy decay from the transition.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is dominated by the final step of Floor 1 progression. With the ladder already open and no immediate threats visible, the player will bypass any remaining resource gathering on this floor to descend. The next 15 steps will focus entirely on establishing a foothold on Floor 2 by killing the requisite number of mobs to open the subsequent ladder.

Headline: Immediate ladder descent and equipment optimization on Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right toward the open ladder at (5, 0) and descends to Floor 2, prioritizing progression over further gathering.
2. [t+4 to t+8] Upon landing on Floor 2, the player assesses the new environment; with the ladder now the primary objective, they will scan for the next ladder location while avoiding unnecessary combat unless the ladder is blocked.
3. [t+9 to t+15] If the new ladder is not immediately adjacent, the player will cautiously explore the perimeter of Floor 2 to locate it, maintaining high resource reserves (Food/Drink/Energy) to ensure survival during the search.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by the transition to Floor 2 and the subsequent hunt for the next ladder. Since the player is already well-equipped (Stone Pickaxe, Iron Sword) and has sufficient resources, no immediate crafting or combat is required unless the new floor presents an immediate threat or blocks the path to the ladder. The player's focus remains strictly on vertical progression.

2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to the next floor, leaving the current resources (Stone, Coal, Iron Sword) behind as per the progression priority.

With the ladder already open and survival stats stable (Health 7, Energy 7), the player will bypass any minor resource gathering on Floor 1 to move to Floor 2. The next 15 steps will likely consist of the descent itself followed by an initial assessment and resource grab on the new floor to prepare for the next descent.

Headline: Immediate ladder descent and early Floor 2 resource consolidation.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves directly to the open ladder at (0, -4) and descends to Floor 2, prioritizing progression over immediate upgrades since survival resources are stable.
2. [t+4 to t+8] Upon landing on Floor 2, the player navigates the path at column -2 and begins clearing the surrounding darkness tiles to locate the next ladder and any spawning troops required to open it.
3. [t+9 to t+15] If the new ladder remains closed or no immediate threats appear, the player gathers the nearby stone and coal found in the darkness zones to craft a Stone Sword, upgrading from the current Iron Sword only if the new floor's resources justify the shift or if the ladder is still inaccessible.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by vertical progression to Floor 2 and the initial exploration of that new layer. The player will likely spend the first few moves transitioning floors and then immediately pivoting to either killing mobs to open the next ladder or gathering local stone/coal to upgrade their sword, depending on the immediate density of resources versus enemies encountered.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Descent to Floor 2 and immediate resource consolidation.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player continues moving DOWN to reach the new floor, likely encountering the closed ladder and initial mobs of Floor 2.
2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon landing, the player engages nearby enemies to reach the required 8 kills to open the ladder, prioritizing survival over mining.
3. [t+12 to t+15] Once the ladder opens, the player descends to Floor 3, then immediately begins gathering wood and stone to craft a Stone Pickaxe for better resource acquisition.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by vertical progression. The player will spend the first half clearing the current floor to unlock the descent, then immediately transition to gathering basic resources (wood/stone) on the new floor to upgrade their pickaxe, ensuring they are better equipped for deeper exploration.

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 followed by resource consolidation and safety setup.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves left from (0,0) toward the open ladder at (0,-1), avoiding the Fireball at (-1,-1) and the Orc Mage at (1,-1) by utilizing the path tiles directly adjacent to the ladder.
2. [t+4 to t+6] The player descends the ladder to Floor 2, arriving at coordinates roughly (0,0) on the new floor, while the ladder remains open for potential ascent if needed.
3. [t+7 to t+15] Upon landing, the player assesses the new environment for the next ladder (likely requiring 8 troop kills to open) and begins gathering nearby resources (wood/stone) to craft a crafting table if one is missing, ensuring survival stability before further exploration.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by the high-priority action of descending to the next floor. Once on Floor 2, the player will shift focus to securing the area (checking for immediate threats like the Orc Mages seen on Floor 1) and establishing a base for resource gathering to prepare for the next descent.

Headline: Immediate survival response to Orc Mage aggression followed by ladder descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+6 to t+11] With Health critically low and no safe enclosure nearby, the player retreats toward the fountain at (0, -1) or uses a Green potion to stabilize, prioritizing Health restoration over resource gathering.
3. [t+12 to t+15] Once Health is stabilized, the player immediately navigates to the open ladder at (0, -1) and descends to Floor 2, leaving the hostile area.

Trajectory summary:
The next window is defined by a high-risk combat encounter that forces a shift from exploration to pure survival. The player will likely suffer health loss from the Orc Mages, necessitate an immediate potion use or retreat to the fountain, and then prioritize descending the ladder once stable, bypassing any equipment upgrades.

Headline: Immediate resource consolidation and ladder hunting on Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves down the central column (Column 0) to locate the closed ladder, prioritizing movement over combat to assess the kill count needed for progression.
2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon confirming the ladder is closed, the player engages nearby troops (implied by "Darkness" and standard dungeon logic) to reach the 8-kill threshold, utilizing the Iron Sword and Diamond Pickaxe for efficiency.
3. [t+12 to t+15] If the kill count is reached, the player descends; if not, the player begins mining the surrounding path tiles for additional stone or coal to craft a crafting table, ensuring a stable base before further exploration.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by a binary progression loop: either descending the ladder immediately upon clearing the floor's mob count, or pausing to secure basic crafting infrastructure (table/furnace) if the kill threshold isn't met. The player's high-tier tools and full stats allow for rapid clearing, making the primary variable the random spawn rate of troops versus the player's mining speed.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate survival stabilization and resource gathering on Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves left toward the visible path at (-2, -2) and (-1, -2) to establish a safe corridor, avoiding the darkness and potential mobs while checking for the ladder location.
2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon confirming the ladder is closed (requiring 8 kills), the player engages nearby enemies or gathers wood/stone from the path tiles to begin the kill count, prioritizing safety over speed.
3. [t+12 to t+15] Once the kill count reaches 8 and the ladder opens, the player immediately descends to Floor 3, or if the ladder remains closed, continues clearing the immediate area for resources.

Trajectory summary:
The next window is defined by the "Survive" and "Take the ladder" priorities. With the ladder closed, the player must balance combat for progression against the need to secure a safe zone before engaging. If the ladder opens quickly, the focus shifts entirely to descent; otherwise, local resource gathering becomes the primary activity.
