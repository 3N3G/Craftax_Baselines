Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 1 via the open ladder on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves toward the open ladder (likely at or near the spawn point given the "Ladder Open: True" status on Floor 0) and descends to Floor 1.
2. [t+4 to t+8] Upon arriving on Floor 1, the player explores the immediate vicinity to locate the new ladder and assess the local mob density, as the new ladder is initially closed.
3. [t+9 to t+15] The player engages nearby troops to progress toward the 8-kill requirement for the Floor 1 ladder, while scavenging for wood or stone if encountered to begin tool crafting.

Trajectory summary:
The player bypasses resource gathering on Floor 0 because the ladder is already open, prioritizing immediate floor progression. The focus shifts instantly to the new floor's mechanics: locating the closed ladder and initiating combat to unlock it, with resource gathering becoming a secondary activity only if materials are found during the kill count.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate resource gathering to enable tool crafting on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the nearest trees (e.g., at 1,1 or -1,2) and chops wood to build an inventory stock, as no tools or crafting table exist yet.
2. [t+6 to t+10] With wood secured, the player likely crafts a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe to begin mining stone, which is necessary for the next tool tier.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player locates and mines nearby stone tiles, transitioning from raw resource gathering to basic equipment preparation.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by the "gather wood -> craft table -> craft pickaxe" loop required to unlock stone mining. Since the ladder is already open but the player lacks any tools to efficiently clear future floors or upgrade, the priority remains establishing a basic crafting foundation before descending.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition followed by ladder descent on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves to (1, 0) to engage the Cow, prioritizing this over exploration due to critically low Food (2/9).
2. [t+4 to t+6] The player kills the Cow and consumes the meat, raising Food to a safe level and preventing Health decay.
3. [t+7 to t+15] With survival needs met and the Ladder already open on Floor 0, the player navigates directly to the ladder and descends to Floor 1.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are driven by the urgent need to eat before descending. Once the Cow is processed, the player will immediately execute the progression goal of taking the open ladder, bypassing further resource gathering on Floor 0.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition followed by ladder descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves toward the Cow at (1, 0) and attacks it to raise Food from 2 to a safe level, prioritizing survival over other goals.
2. [t+4 to t+6] After securing food, the player navigates back toward the known ladder location (likely near the furnace at (0, 4) or the path network) since LadderOpen is True.
3. [t+7 to t+10] The player descends the ladder to Floor 1, transitioning from resource gathering to floor progression.
4. [t+11 to t+15] Upon arriving on Floor 1, the player begins exploring the new map to locate the next ladder and kill troops to open it, as the new floor's ladder starts closed.

Trajectory summary:
The player is currently food-critical (Food=2) despite full health. The immediate trajectory is a short combat loop to kill the nearby Cow, followed by a rapid descent down the open ladder to Floor 1. Once on the new floor, the focus shifts to clearing mobs to unlock the next descent point.

Headline: Ladder-clearing combat and resource scavenging on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves away from the closed ladder to explore the visible path network, prioritizing the discovery of the 8 required troops to open the ladder.
2. [t+6 to t+10] Upon encountering mobs, the player engages them with the Iron Sword; if a chest is found at (5,4) or resources are spotted, the player pauses to gather wood or stone if needed, though the Stone Pickaxe is already equipped.
3. [t+11 to t+15] After killing the necessary number of troops, the player returns to the ladder at (0,0) to verify it is open and descends to Floor 2, or continues hunting if the kill count is not yet reached.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by the "Ladder Open: False" constraint. The player will aggressively hunt mobs to unlock progression while scavenging for any missed resources like coal or extra wood. Survival stats are currently high, so the focus remains entirely on combat and unlocking the descent rather than crafting or resting.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering on Floor 1 to unlock the descent ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves away from the ladder_up at (0,0) to explore the visible path network, likely heading toward the chest at (5,4) or the fountain at (-1,0) to replenish drink and check for loot.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player engages in combat with the first encountered troops (likely spawning in the dark or near the chest) to begin the count toward opening the descent ladder, while simultaneously mining any visible stone or coal.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player continues clearing mobs to reach the 8-kill threshold; if the ladder opens, the player will immediately prioritize descending, otherwise they will continue exploring the visible perimeter for resources and enemies.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by the transition from arrival to active floor clearing. With the ladder closed and resources (coal/iron) currently at zero, the player must kill 8 mobs to progress. The trajectory involves moving out from the spawn point, engaging enemies to open the ladder, and potentially grabbing the chest or drinking from the fountain if they lie on the path to combat. Survival is currently stable, so the focus is entirely on progression mechanics.

4. [t+13 to t+15] Upon arrival on Floor 2, the player immediately begins exploring the new immediate vicinity to locate the first enemy or resource node, as the new ladder is closed.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in a "progression" state with full health and nearly full drink. The immediate priority is to top off drink and then utilize the open ladder to descend. The next 15 steps will likely conclude with the player arriving on Floor 2 and beginning the new cycle of exploration and combat required to open the next ladder.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 via the open ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves from (0,0) to the ladder location (likely at -3,0 or nearby based on path connectivity) and descends to Floor 2.
2. [t+4 to t+8] Upon arrival, the player assesses the new floor; the ladder is now closed and requires 8 kills to reopen. The player engages the first visible mob to begin the count.
3. [t+9 to t+15] The player continues clearing the immediate area for resources and kills, prioritizing safety while hunting for the next 7 enemies needed to open the descent ladder.

Trajectory summary:
The player immediately capitalizes on the open ladder to progress to Floor 2. The focus shifts instantly from resource gathering to combat, as the new floor's ladder is locked behind a kill requirement. Survival stats are currently high enough to sustain this aggressive transition without needing to stop for food, drink, or sleep.

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 via the open ladder after a brief westward probe.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player continues moving left (West) along the path at Row 0, likely placing a torch at (-4, 0) or (-5, 0) to illuminate the darkness and check for the ladder's location or nearby threats.
2. [t+5 to t+8] Upon confirming the area is clear or locating the ladder (which is open), the player turns and navigates back toward the ladder's coordinates to initiate descent.
3. [t+9 to t+12] The player takes the ladder down to Floor 2. The player's stats (Health 7, Energy 7) remain stable during the transition, though Energy will begin to tick down slightly upon arrival.
4. [t+13 to t+15] On Floor 2, the player immediately begins exploring the new floor's entrance area, looking for the new ladder (initially closed) and resources, while monitoring the drop in Energy.

Trajectory summary:
The player is on Floor 1 with the ladder already open, making progression the highest priority. The immediate future involves a short verification sweep to the west, followed by a decisive move to descend to Floor 2. Once on the new floor, the focus shifts instantly to exploration and clearing mobs to open the next ladder, as survival stats are currently sufficient to delay resource gathering or sleeping.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player moves from the current position (0,0) toward the open ladder, likely navigating the path at (0,1) or (1,0) to reach the descent point.
2. [t+5 to t+8] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to Floor 2, triggering a new map generation and resetting the local threat assessment.
3. [t+9 to t+15] On the new floor, the player immediately scans for the new ladder location and nearby resources (wood/stone) while maintaining high energy and health, as the previous floor's ladder is now behind them.

With the ladder already open and survival stats (Health, Food, Drink, Energy) all high, the player's algorithm dictates immediate progression. The next 15 steps will almost certainly result in the player leaving Floor 1 and beginning the exploration phase on Floor 2, rather than engaging in further resource gathering or combat on the current floor.
