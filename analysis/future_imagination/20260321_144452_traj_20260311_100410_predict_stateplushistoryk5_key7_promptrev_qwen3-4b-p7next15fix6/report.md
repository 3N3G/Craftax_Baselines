Headline: Securing initial resources and preparing for ladder descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player gathers wood from nearby trees to start crafting tools and improve resource gathering efficiency.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player searches for a crafting table to craft a stone pickaxe, enabling progression to higher-tier materials.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With the stone pickaxe obtained, the player begins mining stone to advance tool upgrades and prepare for ladder descent.

Trajectory summary: 
The next few moves focus on gathering wood and finding a crafting table to start upgrading tools. Once the stone pickaxe is crafted, the player will transition to mining stone and preparing for the ladder descent.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate ladder use and resource gathering on floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player uses the ladder to descend to floor 1, gaining 1 player_xp which can be used to upgrade an attribute.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player gathers nearby trees for wood, starting the process of acquiring basic tools.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With wood collected, the player looks for a crafting table to make a stone pickaxe, enabling deeper resource extraction.

Trajectory summary: 
The next few moves focus on descending to the next floor and starting early resource gathering. If no interruptions occur, the player will begin crafting tools to facilitate further progression.

Headline: Using the ladder to descend to floor 2 and securing initial resources.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player uses the ladder at (0, 3) to descend to floor 2, gaining 1 player_xp. The ladder remains open for ascension.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player explores floor 2, gathering wood and stone to craft iron tools and prepare for further progression.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With basic tools upgraded, the player begins searching for a crafting table and resources to support deeper floor exploration.

Trajectory summary: 
The player immediately uses the open ladder to descend, then focuses on gathering resources and upgrading tools for the next floor. Once basic tools are secured, the player will start looking for essential crafting structures to continue progression.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves downward toward the torch on path at (0, -4) to secure a light source and navigate the dark areas.
2. [t+6 to t+11] The player likely explores the path to the ladder, which is open, and prepares to descend by ensuring resources are sufficient and health is stable.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With the ladder secured, the player descends to the next floor, gaining XP and potentially upgrading equipment based on the new floor's challenges.

Trajectory summary: 
The immediate future involves navigating dark areas to find the ladder and ensuring survival before descending. Once the ladder is confirmed, the player will descend to the next floor, using the gained XP to potentially upgrade equipment.
