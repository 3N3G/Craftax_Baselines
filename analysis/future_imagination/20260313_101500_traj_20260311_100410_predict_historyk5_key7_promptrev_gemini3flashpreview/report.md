Headline: Initial resource gathering and intrinsic stabilization in the Overworld.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+10] The player will likely move toward the nearest trees (such as at (1, 1) or (2, 2)) to begin harvesting wood. This is the standard opening move to establish a resource base for tools.
2. [t+11 to t+30] After securing wood, the player will plausibly seek out water (located at -5, 0) or food sources to maintain intrinsics. If a zombie or spider spawns nearby, the player will be forced into early combat, potentially losing health before a wooden sword can be crafted.
3. [t+31+] Once basic wood tools are crafted, the player will likely look for stone to upgrade to a stone pickaxe. Since the ladder is already open (as is standard for the Overworld), the player might descend to Floor 1 early if they struggle to find surface minerals, though they risk being under-equipped.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in the very first moments of the game. Near-term behavior will focus on the "resource loop," specifically punching trees to acquire wood. The presence of water to the north (-5, 0) provides a safety net for the "survival loop." The trajectory is currently low-risk, but uncertainty remains regarding the spawn rate of hostile mobs which could derail early gathering efforts.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state using short history context.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
And these general progression patterns:
1) Progression: find ladder and descend floors.
   - Overworld can descend directly.
   - On deeper floors ladders generally open after enough kills (usually 8).
2) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)
Note that this game has uncertainty: where mobs spawn, what the map looks like beyond current observation, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but still make specific claims. Broad general predictions are not useful.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Use recent history to infer momentum and near-term intent.
- Stay grounded in the provided state/history.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (for example: "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").

Headline: Immediate focus on food security before potential floor descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+284 to t+290] The player will likely engage the Cow at (1, 0) using the Iron Sword. With Food at a critical level of 2, obtaining raw meat is the immediate priority to prevent health decay.
2. [t+291 to t+310] After securing food, the player will likely return to the furnace (last seen at -1, 4 at t=280) to cook the meat. Given the inventory contains 5 Wood and 17 Stone, they have the resources to fuel a furnace or craft additional utility items if needed.
3. [t+311 to t+350] Once Food is stabilized, the player is well-positioned for progression. Since "LadderOpen=True" on Floor 0, they will plausibly seek out the downward ladder to descend to Floor 1, as their equipment (Iron Sword, Stone Pickaxe) is sufficient for early-game subterranean exploration.

Trajectory summary:
The player is currently in a high-risk state due to low food but possesses a strong weapon. The immediate trajectory involves harvesting the nearby cow and using the previously located furnace. Once the survival loop is stabilized, the "LadderOpen" status suggests a shift toward the progression loop, moving to deeper floors to utilize their iron gear and stone tools. Uncertainty remains regarding the exact location of the ladder and potential mob spawns during the traversal to the furnace.

Headline: Exploration and resource gathering on Floor 1 begins with a focus on nearby points of interest.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+299 to t+305] The player will likely move toward the chest located at (5, 4) to acquire early-floor loot. Given the proximity of a fountain at (-1, 0), they may also loop back to top off their Drink stat if it falls further.
2. [t+306 to t+325] With an Iron Sword and Stone Pickaxe already equipped, the player will plausibly engage any early Floor 1 mobs (like zombies or skeletons) to begin the 8-kill requirement for opening the next ladder. 
3. [t+326+] If no immediate threats overwhelm them, the player is likely to explore the dark regions to the left or follow the pathing to find ore deposits (Coal/Iron) to utilize their 19 stones for further crafting or to upgrade their current gear.

Trajectory summary:
The player has successfully transitioned from the Overworld to Floor 1 and is currently in an exploratory phase. Near-term momentum suggests a "looting" priority (targeting the visible chest) followed by a shift into the progression loop (hunting mobs for XP and ladder access). Survival is currently stable, but the player will need to find a food source soon as Food is at 8 and will continue to decay during exploration.

Headline: Sustained hydration and snail encounter precede floor exploration.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player will likely continue using the fountain at (1,0) to fully cap their Drink stat, as they have used the "DO" action twice recently to increase it from 7 to 9.
2. [t+6 to t+15] With the Snail currently at (3,0) moving closer, the player will plausibly engage it with their Iron Sword. Given the player's high health (9) and the snail's low threat, this will likely result in a small XP gain.
3. [t+16 to t+30] Once the immediate area is cleared and intrinsics are stabilized, the player is likely to seek the ladder to Floor 2, as the "LadderOpen" flag is already True. They will move through the pathing to find the exit, likely utilizing their 14 torches to illuminate the darkness to the north or south.

Trajectory summary:
The player is currently in a "survival/stabilization" micro-loop, topping off water before moving. Momentum suggests they will finish hydrating, dispatch the nearby Snail, and then pivot to the "progression loop" by locating the ladder. Since the ladder is already open, the transition to the next floor is the most probable mid-term goal, provided they don't get sidetracked by resource nodes in the unmapped darkness.

Headline: Intentional navigation toward the ladder likely precedes floor descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+10] The player is moving consistently left (4 consecutive `LEFT` actions). Given `LadderOpen=True` and the presence of a fountain at (-2, 3), the player will likely continue exploring this room's perimeter or seeking the exit ladder.
2. [t+11 to t+25] With intrinsics (Food/Drink/Energy) slightly depleted but stable, the player will plausibly use the fountain if thirst drops further, or begin searching for the ladder to Floor 2.
3. [t+26+] Once the ladder is located, the player is likely to descend. Since they possess an Iron Sword and Diamond, they are well-equipped for early Floor 2 combat, though low Health (7.0) may force a period of resting or potion usage before engaging mobs.

Trajectory summary:
The player exhibits strong directional momentum, suggesting a search for a specific objective—most likely the ladder, given it is already unlocked. Near-term focus remains on navigation through the dungeon's corridors. Uncertainty exists regarding the exact location of the ladder and whether any hostile mobs will spawn in the darkness to intercept the player before they can descend.

Headline: Exploration of Floor 1 continues with a focus on fountain utilization and minor mob clearing.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+10] The player is currently moving right and down towards a fountain at (3, 2). They will likely engage the nearby Snails at (2, 0) and (4, -1) to gain XP, as they are currently at Floor 1 with only 1 XP.
2. [t+11 to t+30] With the ladder already open (LadderOpen=True), the player's primary goal is likely stabilization before descending. They will plausibly use the fountain to top off Drink and potentially Health. Given the inventory (Diamond, Rubies, and Stone), they may look for a crafting table to further upgrade equipment before moving to Floor 2.
3. [t+31+] Once intrinsics are maximized and the immediate area is cleared of Snails, the player will likely seek the ladder to descend. The timing of this depends on finding the ladder's location in the remaining "darkness" tiles.

Trajectory summary:
The player exhibits a methodical exploration pattern on Floor 1. Having already triggered the ladder, they are not in a rush to descend, instead prioritizing resource security (fountain access) and low-risk combat (Snails) to build XP. The presence of a Diamond Pickaxe and Iron Sword suggests they are well-equipped for this floor, making a safe transition to the next floor highly probable once the ladder is located.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state using short history context.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
And these general progression patterns:
1) Progression: find ladder and descend floors.
   - Overworld can descend directly.
   - On deeper floors ladders generally open after enough kills (usually 8).
2) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)
Note that this game has uncertainty: where mobs spawn, what the map looks like beyond current observation, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but still make specific claims. Broad general predictions are not useful.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Use recent history to infer momentum and near-term intent.
- Stay grounded in the provided state/history.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (for example: "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").

Headline: Exploration of Floor 2 begins with a focus on mob clearing for ladder activation.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+15] Having just descended to Floor 2 at t=2195, the player will likely move away from the `ladder_up` (0,0) to explore the immediate vicinity. Since Floor 2 requires kills (typically 8) to open the next ladder, the player will plausibly seek out mobs like spiders or zombies while navigating around `stalagmites`.
2. [t+16 to t+40] If health remains high (currently 9/9), the player will engage in combat using the Iron Sword. If no mobs are immediately visible in the current light radius, they will likely move toward the edges of the "Darkness" to expand their map knowledge, potentially placing one of their 20 torches to maintain visibility.
3. [t+41+] Once the survival loop is tested by Floor 2's higher mob density, the player will either continue the progression loop (hunting for the remaining kills needed) or, if food/drink levels drop below 4, pivot toward using a Green potion or finding a fountain to stabilize.

Trajectory summary:
The player has successfully transitioned from Floor 1 to Floor 2 and is currently in the early exploration phase. Momentum suggests a shift from the "progression loop" (finding the ladder) back to the "combat/resource loop" to satisfy the kill requirement for the next floor. Near-term behavior will be dominated by tactical movement to reveal the map while maintaining high intrinsics. Uncertainty lies in the spawn rate and type of mobs encountered in the darkness.
