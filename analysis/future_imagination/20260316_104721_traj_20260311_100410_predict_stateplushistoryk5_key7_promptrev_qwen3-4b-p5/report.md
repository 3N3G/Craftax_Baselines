Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering with available tools.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely explores nearby trees to gather wood, using the default pickaxe to collect resources in the area around (2, -4), (-3, -3), and (1, -3).
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may attempt to craft a wooden pickaxe or tool to improve efficiency in resource gathering, especially near the tree at (1, 1) and (5, 1).
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player is likely to search for the ladder to descend, possibly encountering water tiles at (-5, -1) to (-5, 2) that may affect movement or require crossing.

Trajectory summary: The player's near future involves initial exploration and basic resource gathering. With the ladder open, progression toward deeper floors is possible, though resource efficiency and map navigation will be key factors. If the player can secure better tools, the transition to more advanced tasks becomes more feasible.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching/using ladder_down on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, ladder_down is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first: drink water for thirst, eat animals for food, sleep in safe situations for energy)
   - resource loop (wood, stone, iron, diamond tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the event list focused (typically 3-6 events) unless a lon

Headline: Resource gathering and intrinsic stabilization will precede floor progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving left towards the tree cluster to gather wood for tool upgrades, unless a threat interrupts.
2. [t+9 to t+24] A nearby enemy may spawn, forcing the player to fight it off to protect gathered resources.
3. [t+25] The player replenishes intrinsics with food, drink, and energy to recover from the fight and prepare for further exploration.
4. [t+36] The player may then proceed to gather stone, upgrading tools and preparing for potential floor progression. 

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to focus on gathering resources and stabilizing intrinsics before attempting to descend. The path is expected to be gradual, with possible interruptions from enemies. Exact outcomes depend on random events and unseen map regions.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering before floor progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely explores the path at -1, -3 and -2, looking for resources and the ladder_down, while managing intrinsics like food and drink.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may gather additional wood and stone from the path and moss areas, using the stone pickaxe to improve efficiency.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player may attempt to find the ladder_down in the area around -5, -4, and prepare for potential floor progression if the ladder opens.

Trajectory summary: The player's near future involves cautious exploration and resource gathering, with a focus on preparing for potential floor progression. If the ladder_down becomes accessible, the player will likely descend, but this depends on encountering enough mobs to open it. Intrinsics will need regular management to ensure survival during this phase.

Headline: Resource gathering and survival stabilization expected before progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving right towards the cluster of stone and fountain, using the fountain to replenish drink and stabilize intrinsics.
2. [t+9 to t+16] The player may encounter a snail or other small threat, requiring a quick fight or evasion to avoid health loss.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player looks for food and water to maintain energy and drink levels, ensuring survival stability before proceeding further.
4. [t+25] The player may attempt to use the ladder_down to descend, assuming the floor's threat level is manageable and the player is well-prepared. 

Trajectory summary:
The player is likely to focus on stabilizing intrinsics and gathering resources before committing to progression. The path is expected to be gradual, with survival and resource management taking priority. Exact events remain uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of encounters and map exploration.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering in a complex dungeon layout.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+10] The player likely moves right along the path at (0,0) to explore the open area, collecting resources like wood and stone while avoiding dark areas.
2. [t+11 to t+20] The player may find the torch at (-3,0) and use it to increase light, making exploration safer and more efficient.
3. [t+21 to t+30] The player likely heads toward the fountain at (-3,3) to replenish drink and mana, then proceeds to search for the ladder_down to descend further into the dungeon.

Trajectory summary: The player's near future involves cautious exploration of the mapped area, resource collection, and preparation for deeper dungeon progression. With the ladder open, the player is positioned to descend and face new challenges, though encounters with enemies or environmental hazards could alter the timeline.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching/using ladder_down on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, ladder_down is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first: drink water for thirst, eat animals for food, sleep in safe situations for energy)
   - resource loop (wood, stone, iron, diamond tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Headline: Resource gathering and survival stabilization likely precede progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving left towards the cluster of stone, unless a nearby threat interrupts.
2. [t+9 to t+16] The player may encounter a threat, forcing a fight that could deplete Energy or Health, necessitating a stop to replenish intrinsics.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player looks for cows and water to replenish intrinsics, stabilizing Health and Energy before continuing.
4. [t+25 to t+32] The player may then move left to gather remaining stone, upgrading tools and preparing for progression.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to focus on gathering resources and stabilizing intrinsics before committing to progression. The path is likely to involve continued movement left, with potential interruptions from threats. Exact outcomes remain uncertain due to random encounters and partial map visibility.

Headline: Progression likely resumes after stabilizing intrinsics and gathering resources.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving down towards the ladder, as the ladder is open and the floor progression loop suggests descent is imminent.
2. [t+9 to t+16] The player may encounter enemies in the lower areas, requiring combat to clear threats before descending.
3. [t+17 to t+24] The player will likely replenish Food, Drink, and Energy to stabilize intrinsics after combat, ensuring readiness for the next floor.
4. [t+25] The player uses the ladder to descend to the next floor, assuming no major interruptions or unexpected events occur.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to follow a progression-oriented path, prioritizing descent after stabilizing intrinsics. The timeline is somewhat flexible due to uncertain encounters and random events, but the overall direction is clear: continue moving down, prepare for the next floor, and manage resources accordingly.

The player is likely to focus on gathering resources and upgrading tools before proceeding with floor progression. The current floor offers accessible resources, and the next floor's ladder is closed, suggesting a period of stabilization and preparation. If no major interruptions occur, the player will likely move towards tool upgrades and further exploration. Exact outcomes depend on random encounters and environmental factors.
