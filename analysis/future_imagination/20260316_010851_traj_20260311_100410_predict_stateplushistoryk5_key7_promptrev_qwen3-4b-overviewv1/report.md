Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering in a clustered forest area.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely explores the nearby trees to gather wood and saplings, using the default pickaxe.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may find a way to craft a wooden pickaxe or tool to improve resource collection efficiency.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player probably investigates the water tiles at -5, 0 to 2 for potential resources or hazards, while monitoring the open ladder for progression.

Trajectory summary: The next phase is focused on gathering resources in the nearby forest and water areas. If the player successfully crafts tools, they can increase efficiency and prepare for exploration beyond the current area. Progression to the next floor is possible once the player has better tools and resources.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching/using ladder_down on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, ladder_down is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the event list focused (typically 3-6 events) unless a longer list is clearly necessary.
- Keep the trajectory summary short (typically one compact paragraph; use tw

Headline: Resource gathering and intrinsic stabilization will precede floor progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues exploring nearby trees and water sources, gathering wood and stone for tool creation, unless interrupted by hostile encounters.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player will likely focus on crafting tools and improving gear before attempting to descend, given the open ladder and available resources.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly moves toward the ladder to descend, contingent on successful resource gathering and intrinsic maintenance, with uncertainty around encounter outcomes and map exploration. 

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to prioritize gathering resources and stabilizing intrinsics before attempting to progress to higher floors. The timeline for progression is uncertain due to potential interruptions and the partial observability of the map.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering ahead with potential progression opportunities.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely moves right along the path toward the cow at (1, 0), gathering stones and wood as needed.
2. [t+6 to t+12] The player may craft a better tool using the stone pickaxe and gather more resources, especially stone, to prepare for potential floor progression.
3. [t+13 to t+20] The player is likely to explore further right, investigate the ladder at (5, 0), and assess potential threats or progression opportunities, assuming intrinsics remain stable.

Trajectory summary: The player is in a position to gather resources and prepare for progression. If the ladder at (5, 0) is accessible and no immediate threats arise, the next phase will involve exploring toward the ladder and preparing for floor descent. Resource management and tool upgrades are key in the near term.

Headline: Resource gathering and threat assessment likely dominate the next phase.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues gathering resources in the current area, focusing on wood and stone, given the presence of path tiles and the availability of tools.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player may begin assessing nearby threats, such as the cow on path, and prepare for potential encounters.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly moves toward exploring deeper areas or preparing for descent, depending on the success of resource gathering and threat mitigation.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to focus on resource gathering and threat assessment in the near term, with a potential shift toward progression as resources and intrinsics stabilize. The exact timing and outcomes depend on encounters and resource availability.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering in a constrained corridor.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely moves right along the path at row -1, column -4, encountering wall_moss and eventually reaching the fountain at -1, 0.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player may gather wood and stone from the nearby path tiles and use the stone pickaxe to mine more stone.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player likely investigates the ladder_up at 0, 0, which is on a path, and may attempt to ascend if the ladder opens or if the player has enough resources to proceed.

Trajectory summary: The player's next steps involve moving through the accessible path at row -1, gathering resources, and preparing for potential progression. The ladder_up at (0, 0) is a key target, but its usability depends on the player's resource accumulation and the opening of the ladder.

Headline: Progression intent likely accelerates with floor 1 exploration and potential threat clearing.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues exploring floor 1, focusing on gathering resources and navigating darkness, with the fountain and ladder_up being key points of interest.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If the player clears threats or finds useful items, intent likely shifts toward descending further or upgrading tools/armor, given the XP gain and the presence of a chest.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly commits to deeper exploration or progression, depending on resource discovery and encounter outcomes, with floor 1 serving as a critical staging area.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to continue exploring floor 1, focusing on resource gathering and threat clearing, with a potential shift toward progression or tool upgrades if key items are found. The floor's layout and stochastic encounters will influence the timing and direction of further actions.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource gathering in a corridor with a potential progression target.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely moves right along the path at (0,0) and explores the corridor, encountering the torch at (-3,0) and the fountain at (-2,3).
2. [t+6 to t+12] The player may gather wood and stone from the path tiles to the right and craft a better tool if the stone pickaxe is not sufficient.
3. [t+13 to t+20] The player may attempt to descend using the ladder_down, assuming the floor progression conditions are met, or continue exploring the corridor for resources and threats.

Trajectory summary: The player is in a corridor with accessible resources and a potential progression target. The near future involves gathering resources, possibly crafting tools, and preparing for either further exploration or descent. The player should monitor the ladder_down status and be ready to act on progression opportunities.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching/using ladder_down on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, ladder_down is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.

Headline: Progression readiness likely follows resource stabilization and threat clearance.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving left through the current path, gathering resources or navigating the map, with potential for encountering threats or loot.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player may start clearing threats in the area to open the ladder_down, followed by gathering materials for upgrades.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly descends to the next floor if the ladder opens, with progression dependent on successful threat clearance and resource gathering.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in a phase where resource gathering and map navigation are likely to continue before committing to progression. Stabilizing intrinsics and clearing threats will be key steps before descending. The exact timing and success of these steps depend on encounters and map conditions.

Headline: Progression intent likely accelerates after stable intrinsic management.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues descending toward the ladder_down, as the current direction is down and ladder is open, unless interrupted by a significant threat.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player plausibly shifts focus to clearing threats on this floor before descending, given the presence of snails and the need to meet mob counts for ladder access.
3. [t+25+] The player likely commits to progression by descending once threats are cleared, with timing dependent on encounter outcomes and resource management.

Trajectory summary: The player is likely to continue moving downward toward the ladder, maintaining stability in intrinsics before committing to clearing threats and descending. The exact timing of progression depends on stochastic encounters and resource management, but the intent is clear toward floor progression.
