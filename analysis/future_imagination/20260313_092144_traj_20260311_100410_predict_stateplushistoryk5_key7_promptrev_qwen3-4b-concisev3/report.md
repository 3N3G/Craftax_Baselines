Headline: Immediate resource gathering and tool crafting to enable progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+6] The player likely gathers wood from nearby trees to craft a pickaxe, starting resource collection. 
2. [t+7 to t+12] The player may craft a wooden pickaxe and begin gathering stone from the map to progress toward tool upgrades. 
3. [t+13 to t+24] The player likely constructs a crafting table and crafts a stone pickaxe, enabling more efficient resource gathering and preparation for progression. 

Trajectory summary: The player's near future involves focused resource gathering and tool crafting to enable efficient progression. If no interruptions occur, the player will transition to crafting and exploring for ladders and deeper floors.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
And these general game progression patterns:
1) Progression: find ladder and descend floors.
   - Overworld can descend directly.
   - On deeper floors ladders generally open after enough kills (usually 8).
2) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)
Note that this game has uncertainty: where mobs spawn, what the map looks like beyond the current observation, etc. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims. Broad general predictions are not useful.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the event list focused (typically 3-6 events) unless a longer list is clearly necessary.
- Keep the trajectory summary short (typically one compact paragraph; use two only when major phase changes occur).

Headline: Stabilization and resource gathering will dominate initial phases before progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving and gathering resources in the current area, maintaining intrinsics as a priority.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player may start crafting tools or preparing for deeper exploration, depending on encountered threats.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly begins descending floors or exploring new areas, contingent on resource availability and map discovery.

Trajectory summary: The immediate focus is on stabilizing intrinsics and gathering resources in the current area. Once stable, the player is likely to shift toward crafting and exploration, with progression dependent on resource acquisition and environmental encounters.

Headline: Resource gathering and movement patterns likely persist before progression-focused actions.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving right and gathering resources in the current area, with no immediate threats disrupting the path.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player may begin preparing for progression by upgrading tools or clearing nearby threats, especially if a ladder is used for descent.

Headline: Ladder descent confirmed, with immediate focus on resource gathering and survival stabilization.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player will likely gather resources near the fountain and ladder, using the available wood and stone to craft tools, while monitoring intrinsics to prevent decay.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If survival metrics remain stable, the player will attempt to clear threats in the darkness area, possibly using the torch and iron sword, before attempting to reposition for deeper exploration.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly aims to find a path through the darkness and access the chest at 5,4, with success depending on mob encounters and resource management.

Trajectory summary: The player has descended to floor 1 and is likely to focus on immediate survival and resource gathering before progressing further. The presence of a fountain and ladder suggests a short-term survival loop priority, with potential for tool upgrades and threat clearing in the near term. Uncertainty remains due to the dangerous darkness and random mob encounters.

Headline: Resource refinement and ladder preparation ahead.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+12] The player likely refines wood and stone for tool upgrades, focusing on the stone pickaxe and possibly crafting a better weapon. 
2. [t+13 to t+24] The player may attempt to locate a crafting table or build one, using available materials to improve gear.

Headline: Resource gathering and movement patterns likely persist before progression focus.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving right and gathering resources in the current area, with possible interruptions from mobs or environmental hazards.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player may start preparing for progression by upgrading tools or clearing threats in the current floor.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly begins descending to the next floor if the ladder opens and the necessary kills are completed, depending on map exploration and random encounters.

Trajectory summary:
The player is likely to continue with current resource gathering and movement patterns before shifting focus to progression. Stability of intrinsics will influence the timing of tool upgrades or threat clearing. Descent to the next floor is plausible if the ladder remains open and the required kills are achieved, though this depends on map exploration and random events.

Headline: Early resource setup before first meaningful progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+6] The player likely gathers the three stones to the left using the wooden pickaxe. 
2. [t+7 to t+18] The player may either look for their crafting table or place a new one and craft a stone pickaxe. 
3. [t+19 to t+30] The player may explore the path ahead toward the fountain at -3, 3, or seek out the ladder at -5, 0, depending on mob spawns and resource needs.

Trajectory summary: The near future is likely dominated by low-risk resource collection and setup. If no nearby threat interrupts, the player should transition from basic gathering toward tool upgrades and exploratory movement for progression. Timing can vary with map layout and stochastic encounters.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.

   - Overworld can descend directly.
   - On deeper floors ladders generally open after enough kills (usually 8).

   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Headline: Ladder usage and resource management likely dominate near-term actions.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving left along the path, potentially using torches and gathering resources in the accessible areas.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If intrinsics remain stable, the player may attempt to use the fountain at -5,3 for health/mana restoration and prepare for ladder descent.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly initiates ladder descent if the required kills are achieved, transitioning into deeper floor exploration with upgraded tools.

Trajectory summary:
The player is likely to focus on resource management and intrinsics stabilization before progressing. The presence of a fountain and a ladder suggests a likely shift towards restoration and descent once stability is achieved. Exact outcomes depend on random encounters and resource availability.

Headline: Progression intent likely intensifies with ladder usage and floor descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+8] The player likely continues moving downward, using the ladder to descend floors, as the ladder is open and the direction is set to down.
2. [t+9 to t+24] If the player successfully descends, the focus may shift to clearing threats and gathering resources to upgrade tools and armor.
3. [t+25+] The player plausibly begins exploring deeper floors, with the likelihood of encountering new challenges and opportunities for progression.

Trajectory summary:
The player is likely to continue descending floors using the available ladder, with a focus on movement and potential threat clearing. If successful, the next phase will involve resource gathering and tool upgrades to support further progression. The exact timing and outcomes depend on encounters and the map's layout.
