Headline: Immediate resource acquisition and tool upgrade on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player likely moves to the cluster of trees at (-3,-3) and (1,-3) to gather wood, as the inventory is currently empty and tools are required for mining.
2. [t+5 to t+10] After securing wood, the player will likely craft a wooden pickaxe and search the immediate vicinity for stone deposits to upgrade to stone tools.
3. [t+11 to t+20] With stone tools acquired, the player will likely mine deeper or further afield to locate iron or coal, while monitoring food and drink levels which will naturally decay.
4. [t+21+] The player will likely engage in combat with local mobs to clear the floor for ladder progression, aiming to reach the threshold of 8 kills to open the exit.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on converting the abundant nearby trees into a functional toolset, transitioning from wood to stone to enable efficient resource gathering. Once equipped, the player will likely shift from survival gathering to active floor clearing and resource hunting, with the primary goal of opening the ladder to descend to Floor 1. Success depends on maintaining intrinsics while navigating the stochastic spawn of enemies and resources.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first: drink water for thirst, eat animals for food, sleep in safe situations for energy)
   - resource progression (wood -> stone -> iron -> diamond tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the event list focused (typically 3-6 events) unless

Headline: Immediate resource gathering and tool crafting on Floor 0 likely precedes any descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves towards the nearest tree cluster (likely at 1, -3 or -2, -2) to harvest wood, as they currently possess zero resources.
2. [t+6 to t+12] After securing wood, the player will likely craft a wooden pickaxe and begin mining stone from the visible tree locations (which often imply nearby stone in early game) or move to find stone deposits.
3. [t+13 to t+20] The player crafts a stone pickaxe and potentially a stone sword, upgrading their gear to handle early enemies that may spawn.
4. [t+21 to t+30] With basic tools secured, the player explores the immediate area to locate the ladder or clear the required 8 mobs to open it for descent, assuming the ladder is currently closed or requires clearing.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in a critical setup phase, transitioning from a raw state to a functional one by prioritizing wood and stone acquisition. The immediate future involves localized movement to gather resources and craft essential tools, with a high probability of engaging in combat to clear the floor for ladder access. Descent to Floor 1 is unlikely until the player has secured at least a stone pickaxe and potentially a weapon, as survival and progression loops demand these upgrades first.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition and tool upgrade on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player will likely engage the Cow at (1, 0) to secure food, as current Food (2) is dangerously low and will soon threaten Health.
2. [t+4 to t+10] With the Iron Sword already equipped, the player will prioritize mining the stone cluster at (3, -4) and (4, -4) to gather resources for a Stone Pickaxe, as the current inventory shows only one stone and no coal.
3. [t+11 to t+20] The player will craft a Stone Pickaxe and likely a Stone Sword or Shield to improve efficiency and defense before venturing further into the unexplored path network.
4. [t+21+] Exploration will resume with a focus on locating the ladder to descend, assuming the player maintains Food and Drink levels through foraging or hunting during the search.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future hinges on stabilizing the player's food supply via the nearby cow, followed by a rapid transition to stone-tier equipment to facilitate safer exploration. Once the stone tools are crafted, the player will likely navigate the open path network to locate the ladder and descend, provided they can manage resource consumption without encountering a fatal ambush.

Headline: Immediate resource gathering and intrinsic stabilization likely precedes further exploration.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player will likely move left to mine the visible stone cluster at (3,-4) and (3,-3), increasing their stone count to support tool upgrades.
2. [t+6 to t+12] With Food critically low at 2, the player will likely engage the nearby cow at (1,0) to secure meat, prioritizing survival over further exploration.
3. [t+13 to t+18] After consuming the cow, the player will likely consume the food to restore their Food stat to a safe level, preventing health decay.
4. [t+19 to t+25] The player will likely return to the stone nodes to gather the remaining resources, potentially upgrading their stone pickaxe if they have sufficient materials.
5. [t+26+] Once intrinsics are stable and resources gathered, the player will likely resume movement towards the open ladder or deeper map sections.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is dominated by a survival-critical pivot: the player must address their dangerously low Food level (2) before continuing resource collection. The trajectory will likely involve a brief engagement with the cow at (1,0) followed by mining the nearby stone deposits. Unless interrupted by an unseen enemy, the player will stabilize their intrinsics and expand their stone inventory before considering further progression or descending the ladder.

Headline: Immediate resource consolidation and ladder preparation on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player will likely move right to (0, 0) to interact with the ladder, checking its status, then immediately turn left to secure the fountain at (-1, 0) to stabilize Drink levels before they decay further.
2. [t+4 to t+10] With 19 Stone and a Stone Pickaxe, the player will likely mine the visible wall_moss tiles at (-3, -2) and (-4, -2) to gather additional resources or clear a path, while avoiding the darkness zones to the west.
3. [t+11 to t+20] The player will likely descend the ladder at (0, 0) to Floor 2, as the current floor appears cleared of immediate threats and the ladder is the primary progression vector, though they may first consume a Red potion if health drops unexpectedly during the descent.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on stabilizing hydration via the nearby fountain and utilizing the existing stone tools to clear minor obstacles before descending. The player is well-positioned to move to Floor 2, provided they manage the transition from the lit central corridor to the darker peripheries without losing energy or health. Progression is contingent on the ladder remaining open and no unexpected high-level mobs spawning near the exit.

Headline: Immediate resource gathering near the fountain and torch, followed by floor clearing to open the ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves to (0, -1) to drink from the fountain, restoring Drink to 9 and ensuring Health stability.
2. [t+6 to t+12] The player moves to (-2, -3) to pick up the torch, increasing light levels in the dark corridors to the left and bottom.
3. [t+13 to t+25] The player explores the dark regions (Rows -1 to -4, Cols -5 to -2), likely encountering and killing 2-3 mobs to begin the ladder-opening process.
4. [t+26 to t+40] The player clears the remaining enemies on Floor 1, causing the ladder to open, then descends to Floor 2 to continue the dungeon run.

Trajectory summary:
The player will prioritize immediate survival and visibility by utilizing the nearby fountain and torch before engaging in combat. Once light is secured and intrinsics are stable, the focus shifts to clearing the floor to unlock the ladder. The trajectory assumes no major ambushes prevent the player from reaching the required kill count, leading to a descent to the next floor within the next 40 turns.

Headline: Immediate resource consolidation and tool upgrade on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player likely moves to (1, 0) to drink from the fountain, restoring Drink to 9 and ensuring Health stability, while checking for nearby enemies like the Snail at (3, 0).
2. [t+5 to t+15] With 17 Stone and 5 Wood, the player will almost certainly craft a Stone Pickaxe immediately, as the current inventory lacks one despite having the raw materials, enabling faster mining of the surrounding walls.
3. [t+16 to t+30] The player will likely clear the immediate path to the right or left to locate the ladder, using the Iron Sword to kill any spawned mobs and the Torch to illuminate the dark tiles at (-4, -4) and (-5, -4).
4. [t+31+] If the ladder remains open and no new threats appear, the player will descend to Floor 2, prioritizing the consumption of one Green Potion if Energy drops below 4 during the transition.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on stabilizing intrinsics via the fountain and executing a critical tool upgrade to a Stone Pickaxe. Once equipped, the player will likely clear the immediate darkened corridors to ensure a safe descent, leveraging the currently open ladder. Success depends on avoiding early mob encounters that could deplete the single Iron Sword's durability or the player's Energy before the next floor is reached.

Headline: Player likely engages the Snail at (3,0) before securing resources or descending.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player will likely engage and defeat the Snail at (3,0) using the Iron Sword or Bow, as it is the immediate threat on the current path.
2. [t+4 to t+6] After the fight, the player will likely move to the fountain at (1,0) or (2,0) to replenish Drink, which is currently at 8 and decaying.
3. [t+7 to t+12] The player will likely explore the dark regions to the left (columns -4 to -2) to clear remaining darkness and check for loot or mobs, utilizing the 14 torches.
4. [t+13 to t+15] With the floor likely cleared or resources gathered, the player will likely return to the ladder at (0,0) to descend to Floor 2, as the ladder is already open.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future involves resolving the local Snail encounter and refilling hydration before transitioning to exploration or descent. The player's high resource count (14 torches, 3 green potions) and open ladder suggest a smooth transition to the next floor, provided no unexpected high-level enemies spawn in the dark zones. The trajectory prioritizes safety and resource maintenance over aggressive expansion at this specific moment.

Headline: Securing the fountain and preparing for floor descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right to (0,0) then south to (3,0) to reach the fountain, likely refilling Drink to 9 to stabilize survival.
2. [t+4 to t+8] The player consumes a Green potion to restore Health to 9, ensuring full vitality before engaging the floor's remaining threats.
3. [t+9 to t+15] The player clears the remaining darkness and mobs in the southern corridor (rows 3-5) to ensure the ladder condition (8 mobs killed) is met or maintained.
4. [t+16+] The player descends to Floor 2, utilizing the open ladder, and begins scouting for iron resources given the current stone/iron tool disparity.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on stabilizing intrinsics via the nearby fountain and potion usage, followed by clearing the current floor to maintain ladder accessibility. Once the descent to Floor 2 occurs, the priority shifts to locating iron deposits to upgrade the pickaxe, as the current stone tool is inefficient for the expected higher-tier resources.

Headline: Player likely navigates leftward corridor to clear darkness and locate the fountain before descending.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player continues moving left along the path, illuminating the dark tiles at (-4, -4) and (-3, -4) to reveal the map layout.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player reaches the fountain at (-4, 3) or (-3, 3) to replenish Drink, ensuring Health recovery remains stable before further exploration.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player clears the remaining darkness in the upper-left quadrant, likely encountering a low-level mob given the high kill count threshold for the ladder is already met.
4. [t+16 to t+20] With intrinsics stable and the immediate area lit, the player moves towards the ladder at (0, -1) to descend to Floor 2, as the current floor is largely cleared.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future involves a brief continuation of the leftward path to secure hydration at the fountain and fully reveal the darkened upper-left sector. Once the area is safe and resources are topped up, the player will likely transition from exploration to progression by descending the open ladder to Floor 2. This sequence assumes no unexpected high-level spawns interrupt the movement.

Headline: Securing the fountain and clearing the immediate path on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+4 to t+8] The player engages the two Snails at (4, -1) and (2, 0) using the Iron Sword to clear the path and potentially gain XP or food.
3. [t+9 to t+15] With the immediate corridor cleared, the player likely descends the open ladder to Floor 2, as the current floor is largely unexplored but the ladder is already accessible.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on stabilizing hydration via the nearby fountain and eliminating the two visible Snail threats to secure the path. Once these minor obstacles are removed, the player will almost certainly descend to Floor 2, as the ladder is open and the current floor offers limited immediate progression opportunities compared to the potential resources of the next level.

2. [t+6 to t+12] After clearing the immediate enemies, the player likely proceeds right along the path at row 0 or -1 to explore the open area near the fountain at (3, 2).

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future involves clearing the visible snail enemies in the current sector to ensure a safe path forward. Once the local threats are neutralized, the player's momentum will likely shift towards descending to the next floor, as the ladder is already open and resources are sufficient for a brief transition. Uncertainty remains regarding the density of enemies on the next floor or potential traps in the unexplored darkness to the left.

Headline: Securing the ladder and clearing floor 2 for descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player likely descends to floor 3 immediately, as the ladder at (0,0) is currently open and the current floor (2) appears cleared of immediate threats.
2. [t+4 to t+15] Upon reaching floor 3, the player must kill approximately 8 mobs to open the ladder to floor 4; this will likely involve using the Iron Sword and Bow to manage threats while conserving Energy.
3. [t+16 to t+25] The player will likely encounter stalagmites or darkness on floor 3, requiring the use of remaining Torches and potentially Green potions for healing if combat goes poorly.
4. [t+26+] Once the ladder opens, the player will descend to floor 4, where the primary goal shifts to locating resources (Iron/Coal) to upgrade the Diamond Pickaxe or craft better armor, as current inventory shows 0 Iron.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by a rapid transition to floor 3 to trigger the next ladder, followed by a combat-intensive phase to clear the floor for descent. With full stats and a Diamond Pickaxe, the player is well-equipped for this, but the lack of Iron resources on floor 2 necessitates a focus on looting floor 3. Success depends on surviving the initial mob spawns without depleting the limited Arrow count or Green potions.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state using short history context.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first: drink water for thirst, eat animals for food, sleep in safe situations for energy)
   - resource progression (wood -> stone -> iron -> diamond tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but still make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Use recent history to infer momentum and near-term intent.
- Stay grounded in the provided state/history.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (for example: "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and
