Headline: Immediate ladder descent and resource acquisition on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves up to coordinate (-1, 0) to locate and descend the open ladder to Floor 1.
2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon reaching Floor 1, the player gathers the abundant nearby trees (e.g., at 2, -4 and -3, -3) to craft a wooden pickaxe and sword.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With basic tools secured, the player begins mining stone deposits found on the new floor to prepare for the next tier of equipment.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by vertical progression and initial tool creation. The player will immediately leave the resource-rich but tool-less Floor 0, spend the middle phase gathering wood to craft starter gear, and conclude the window by beginning stone mining to set up for future upgrades.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate resource acquisition and tool crafting to enable floor descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the nearest trees (e.g., at 2,-4 or -2,-2) to gather wood, prioritizing survival stability and tool prerequisites.
2. [t+6 to t+11] With wood secured, the player crafts a wooden pickaxe and sword, then begins mining nearby stone to upgrade to stone tools.
3. [t+12 to t+15] Once stone tools are crafted, the player upgrades their equipment and heads directly to the open ladder to descend to Floor -1.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are a focused transition from gathering raw materials to establishing basic combat utility. The player will efficiently convert local tree resources into stone-tier gear, ensuring survival stability before executing the primary goal of descending the ladder.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition and ladder descent on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right toward the Cow at (1,0) to kill it and eat, raising Food from 2 to 9 to prevent health decay.
2. [t+4 to t+5] With Food restored and survival stable, the player moves directly to the open ladder at (0,0) to descend to Floor 1.
3. [t+6 to t+15] On Floor 1, the player explores the new environment, gathering wood and stone while searching for the next ladder, which remains closed until 8 mobs are killed.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by a critical survival fix followed by standard progression. The player must secure food immediately due to low reserves, then capitalize on the open ladder to move down. Once on Floor 1, the focus shifts to clearing mobs to open the next ladder while gathering basic resources for future upgrades.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition and ladder descent preparation.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right to engage the Cow at (1, 0) to increase Food from 2 to a safe level, preventing health decay.
2. [t+4 to t+7] After eating the Cow, the player likely searches the immediate vicinity or moves slightly to locate the open ladder, prioritizing descent over further gathering.
3. [t+8 to t+15] Once the ladder is located and used, the player transitions to the next floor, where they will likely begin mining stone or iron depending on new spawns, while managing the new decay cycle.

Trajectory summary:
The next window is defined by a critical survival need (Food) followed immediately by progression. The player will not upgrade tools or explore deeply until the Cow is secured and the ladder is taken. Uncertainty remains regarding the exact location of the ladder relative to the Cow, but the priority order ensures food is addressed first.

Headline: Immediate resource consolidation and ladder preparation on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right to the chest at (5, 4) to secure potential loot, then turns toward the central crafting area to utilize the 19 stone and 5 wood for a stone pickaxe upgrade (replacing the wooden one to enable iron mining).
2. [t+6 to t+11] With the stone pickaxe crafted, the player mines nearby stone walls or coal deposits if visible, prioritizing coal gathering to fuel future smelting while maintaining a safe distance from the mossy walls.
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player continues clearing the floor, killing any encountered troops to progress toward the 8-mob threshold required to open the ladder at (0,0), while monitoring food/energy levels.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps focus on stabilizing the player's toolset by upgrading to a stone pickaxe, which is the critical bottleneck for accessing iron. Simultaneously, the player will engage in low-risk combat to accumulate the kills needed to open the ladder, ensuring progression remains the primary goal once the immediate upgrade is complete.

The immediate future is dominated by the high-priority action of descending to Floor 2. Once on the new floor, the player will shift focus to locating the next ladder and potentially killing mobs to open it, as survival resources are currently sufficient to delay urgent upgrades.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder

2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon arriving on Floor 2, the player mines the nearby stone wall to craft a Stone Sword, replacing the current Iron Sword to ensure material efficiency before combat.
3. [t+12 to t+15] The player engages the mobs on Floor 2 to reach the kill count of 8, keeping the ladder open for the next descent, while managing energy levels via the nearby fountain.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by the transition from Floor 1 to Floor 2. The player will secure the descent immediately, then focus on optimizing their weapon tier using local stone resources before committing to the combat loop required to open the next ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+4 to t+8] With Drink restored and survival stable, the player continues moving left through the dark corridors, scanning for the open ladder required to descend to Floor 2, as the current ladder is already open.
3. [t+9 to t+15] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to Floor 2. If no immediate threats appear on the new floor, the player begins clearing the first 8 mobs to keep the ladder open for future ascents or further descent.

Trajectory summary:
The next few moves are defined by resource stabilization (drinking) followed by strict progression. The player will not upgrade equipment or sleep until the Drink stat is recovered and the descent to the next floor is executed, aligning with the priority of staying alive and moving down.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+6 to t+11] Upon landing on Floor 2, the player immediately gathers the nearby fountain water to refill Drink (currently 8) and searches for the new ladder or nearby resources like stone/iron to begin the kill-count for the next descent.
3. [t+12 to t+15] With Drink restored and the new floor explored, the player prioritizes finding the next ladder; if no mobs are encountered, they may craft a stone sword using existing stone and wood to ensure combat readiness before the next floor transition.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by vertical progression. The player will descend to Floor 2, stabilize hydration at the local fountain, and immediately begin the cycle of clearing mobs to open the next ladder, leveraging their current high resource stockpile.
