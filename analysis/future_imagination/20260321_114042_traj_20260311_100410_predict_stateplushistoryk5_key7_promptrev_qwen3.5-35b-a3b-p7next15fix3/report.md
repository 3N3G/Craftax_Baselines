Headline: Immediate ladder descent from Floor 0 to Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves from the current position toward the open ladder on Floor 0, navigating through the nearby trees and water tiles.
2. [t+4 to t+5] The player locates the ladder and descends to Floor 1, triggering a new floor generation with a closed ladder requiring 8 kills to open.
3. [t+6 to t+10] On Floor 1, the player explores the immediate vicinity to locate the new ladder and identify the first enemies (likely Goblins or Orcs) to begin the kill count.
4. [t+11 to t+15] The player engages the first enemy encountered, securing a kill to begin opening the ladder while maintaining full health and resources.

Trajectory summary:
The player bypasses early-game resource gathering on Floor 0 to immediately descend, as the ladder is already open. The next 15 steps will focus on traversing to the ladder, transitioning to Floor 1, and initiating the floor-clearing process by engaging the first mobs to open the descent path.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate resource gathering and tool crafting on Floor 0 with open ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player moves to the nearest trees (e.g., at 2,-4 or -3,-3) and chops wood to build a basic inventory, as the ladder is open but no tools exist yet.
2. [t+5 to t+8] With sufficient wood, the player crafts a wooden pickaxe and immediately begins mining the nearby stone tiles (e.g., at 2,-2 or 1,1) to progress to stone-tier tools.
3. [t+9 to t+12] The player crafts a stone pickaxe and a stone sword, prioritizing the sword for combat safety while continuing to gather stone and potentially coal if visible.
4. [t+13 to t+15] Having secured basic stone equipment, the player either explores further for iron/coal or moves directly toward the open ladder to descend to the next floor.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on rapid conversion of the abundant nearby trees into a wooden pickaxe, followed quickly by stone tools. Since the ladder is already open and the player is on Floor 0, the priority shifts from survival setup to efficient resource gathering before descending, assuming no unexpected high-level enemies appear.

Headline: Securing food and advancing toward the open ladder on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right to engage the Cow at (1, 0) to secure food, as current Food (2) is critically low and threatens health stability.
2. [t+4 to t+6] After consuming the Cow, the player consumes the food to restore the Food stat to a safe level (approx. 5-6) and immediately proceeds right along the path toward the open ladder.
3. [t+7 to t+10] With survival stabilized, the player continues moving right along the corridor, utilizing the open ladder to descend to Floor 1.
4. [t+11 to t+15] Upon arriving on Floor 1, the player begins clearing the initial mobs to open the descent ladder for the next floor, while maintaining a safe distance from any new spawns.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate priority is addressing the low food supply by killing the nearby Cow, followed by a direct push to descend via the open ladder. Once on the next floor, the focus shifts to clearing mobs to unlock further progression.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition from nearby Cow before ladder descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player engages the Cow at (1, 0) with the Iron Sword to secure food, as current Food (2) is critically low and will soon threaten Health.
2. [t+4 to t+6] The player consumes the raw meat to restore Food to a safe level (approx. 5-6), preventing health decay while maintaining high Energy and Drink.
3. [t+7 to t+10] With survival stabilized, the player moves toward the open ladder (likely located in the explored path area or adjacent unexplored tile) to descend to Floor 1.
4. [t+11 to t+15] The player steps onto the ladder, transitioning to the new floor, where they will immediately begin searching for the new floor's ladder and resources.

Trajectory summary:
The next few moves are dictated by the urgent need to replenish Food before the ladder can be safely used. Once the Cow is defeated and eaten, the player will immediately prioritize descending, as the ladder is already open and no further upgrades are needed on Floor 0.

Headline: Securing the fountain and clearing the ladder threshold on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves to (0, -1) to drink from the fountain, restoring Drink to 9 and securing hydration before further exploration.
2. [t+4 to t+8] The player proceeds north along the central path (Column 0) to locate and engage the first enemy troop, initiating the kill count required to open the ladder.
3. [t+9 to t+12] Upon killing the first few mobs, the player continues clearing the immediate corridor to the north, likely encountering a second troop to accelerate ladder opening.
4. [t+13 to t+15] With the ladder potentially open or nearing open status, the player shifts focus to finding the specific descent ladder on this floor or securing a safe spot to sleep if energy dips.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by hydration and combat; the player must secure the fountain and then clear enough enemies on Floor 1 to open the ladder. With high stats and a stone pickaxe, the player is well-positioned to clear the initial mobs quickly without needing to retreat for sleep immediately.

Headline: Securing light and gathering resources to open the ladder on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves right toward the chest at (5,4) and the fountain at (0,-1) to secure loot and water, while navigating the darkened left side of the map.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player likely places a torch or moves to a lit area (near the existing torch at -2,-3) to restore light levels and safely explore the dark corridors to the left.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player begins clearing nearby mobs (likely in the dark zones) to accumulate the kills required to open the ladder, as the ladder remains closed with 0 kills recorded on this floor.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on stabilizing visibility and gathering initial loot before engaging in the floor-clearing grind. With the ladder closed, the player must transition from exploration to combat to unlock the path to Floor 2, prioritizing safety in the dark regions first.

1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right to the fountain at (3, 0) to refill Drink to 9, as they are currently at 8 and moving away from the water source.
2. [t+4 to t+8] With hydration secured, the player proceeds right along the path at Row 0, killing the Snail at (3, 0) if it hasn't been eaten, and continuing toward the ladder location which is likely further right or down the corridor.
3. [t+9 to t+12] The player locates the open ladder (likely near the center-right of the floor given the path layout) and prepares to descend, as survival is stable and the ladder is the highest priority.
4. [t+13 to t+15] The player steps onto the ladder to descend to Floor 2, transitioning to a new map generation.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is a short, linear sequence of hydration and progression. With full health and the ladder already open, the player will quickly top up water, clear any minor path obstacles, and immediately descend to the next floor without pausing for upgrades or exploration.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder

Headline: Descending to Floor 2 with the ladder open and securing resources.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves right along the lit corridor (Row 0) to locate the open ladder, avoiding the darkened areas to the left and right.
2. [t+4 to t+5] The player steps onto the ladder and descends to Floor 2, leaving the current floor's resources (moss, fountain) behind for now.
3. [t+6 to t+10] On Floor 2, the player explores the immediate vicinity to locate the new ladder, prioritizing the discovery of the path while monitoring the 8-kill requirement.
4. [t+11 to t+15] The player engages nearby troops to begin the kill count for the new ladder, utilizing the existing Iron Sword and Bow to maintain high health and energy levels.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by immediate progression; with the ladder open and survival stats high, the player will bypass further upgrades on Floor 1 to descend. The next phase involves clearing the new floor's initial threats to unlock the next descent point.

2. [t+6 to t+10] The player continues probing the open path to the left (Column -4) to locate the ladder, which requires killing 8 mobs on this floor to open.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player likely encounters a mob (Snail or Stalagmite) and kills it, incrementing the kill count toward the 8-mob threshold needed to open the ladder.

The player has successfully descended to Floor 2 and is now in the "ladder preparation" phase. With full stats and a Diamond Pickaxe, the immediate focus is purely exploration and combat to unlock the next descent. The player will likely prioritize clearing the visible path to the left to find the ladder, as no immediate resource upgrades are needed given the current inventory.
