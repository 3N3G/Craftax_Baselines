Headline: Immediate survival stabilization and initial tool acquisition.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player likely descends to Floor -1 to collect water and food sources, stabilizing intrinsics before engaging with the dense tree cluster at (-2, -2) to (3, 3).
2. [t+5 to t+12] Upon gathering sufficient wood, the player crafts a wooden axe and pickaxe, enabling the conversion of nearby trees into planks and stone into basic tools.
3. [t+13+] Exploration shifts toward clearing the immediate tree zone for resources while monitoring the ladder status; if the kill count reaches 8, the player will likely descend to Floor -1 to access deeper ores.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by securing basic sustenance and establishing a primitive crafting loop. Progression to deeper floors is contingent upon resource accumulation and mob clearance thresholds, with the high density of trees presenting a short-term opportunity for rapid tool upgrades. Uncertainty remains regarding hidden map features and potential hostile spawns within the tree cluster.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching/using ladder_down on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, ladder_down is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Stay grounded in the provided state.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (e.g., "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.
- Keep the event list focused (typically 3-6 events) unless a longer list is clearly necessary.
- Keep the trajectory summary short (typically one compact paragraph; use tw

```text
Headline: Immediate resource acquisition and stabilization precede any vertical progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely moves toward the dense tree cluster at (1,1) or (-2,-2) to gather wood, prioritizing tool creation over exploration given the zero-resource inventory.
2. [t+6 to t+12] With basic tools acquired, intent shifts to securing food or defensive items (potions) from the water tiles or clearing minor threats to stabilize intrinsics before descending.
3. [t+13 to t+24] If intrinsics are maintained, the player likely begins clearing a localized area to satisfy the "8 mobs killed" threshold required to open the ladder_down, enabling floor descent.

Trajectory summary:
The near-term trajectory is defined by the resource loop, where gathering and stabilization must occur before the progression loop can activate. The player will likely remain on Floor 0 until sufficient resources are secured and the descent condition is met, making the timing of the ladder opening dependent on both resource acquisition speed and random mob spawns.

Headline: Immediate survival stabilization followed by tool upgrade and initial dungeon descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player likely consumes food or rests to stabilize Health, which is critically low due to depleted Food and Drink intrinsics.
2. [t+5 to t+12] With stabilized vitals, the player gathers the nearby sapling and stone to craft a crafting table and a stone pickaxe, replacing the wooden tool for better ore efficiency.
3. [t+13 to t+20] The player mines the stone deposits at (-4, 3) and (-3, 3) to acquire stone for armor or further tool upgrades, then moves toward the ladder at (0, -4).
4. [t+21+] The player descends to Floor -1; if no mobs are present, they immediately begin clearing the required 8 enemies to open the next ladder.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by a mandatory survival loop to restore Health, followed by a rapid transition to resource acquisition and tool crafting. Once equipped with a stone pickaxe, the player will likely descend to Floor -1, where the progression loop activates contingent on clearing the mob threshold to unlock the next floor. Uncertainty remains regarding the density of enemies on Floor -1 and potential unseen threats in the unexplored map regions ahead.

Headline: Survival stabilization precedes immediate progression due to critical food depletion.

Meanful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player likely prioritizes gathering food (e.g., hunting the nearby Cow or foraging) to prevent Health decay, as Food is critically low at 2.
2. [t+5 to t+15] Once sustenance is secured, the player will likely resume the current rightward movement to clear the path or gather stone/wood, maintaining the resource loop.
3. [t+16+] If the path ahead remains clear and resources are sufficient, the player plausibly shifts focus toward descending to Floor -1, contingent on killing the required 8 mobs on the current floor.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by a survival loop triggered by low Food, delaying the progression loop. Once Health is stabilized, the player will likely continue their established rightward momentum to gather resources or clear the current floor's mob quota before attempting to descend. Uncertainty exists regarding unseen threats ahead and the exact timing of the ladder opening.

Headline: Immediate survival stabilization followed by vertical progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely consumes the Red Potion and gathers nearby saplings/wood to replenish Health and Food before the current reserves decay.
2. [t+6 to t+15] With intrinsics stabilized, the player probably descends the ladder at (0,0) toward the chest at (5,4) to secure resources, assuming no hostile mobs spawn in the path.
3. [t+16+] Upon reaching the chest, the player will likely open it for loot (potentially Iron/Diamond) and then search for a `ladder_down` to trigger floor progression, provided the mob kill count requirement is met.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by stabilizing intrinsics using available consumables, followed by a high-probability descent to the visible chest. Progression to the next floor is contingent on clearing a mob threshold; if the player encounters enemies before reaching the ladder, the trajectory shifts to combat and resource gathering to unlock the descent.

Headline: Survival stabilization and resource expansion likely precede boss engagement.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player likely secures immediate safety by moving toward the torch at (-2, -3) to mitigate darkness risks, while simultaneously harvesting the chest at (5, 4) for potential loot or crafting materials.
2. [t+6 to t+15] With intrinsics stable, intent shifts to resource consolidation; the player will likely gather nearby stone/wood and craft essential items (e.g., more torches or a pickaxe) to prepare for the locked ladder.
3. [t+16 to t+30] Once resources are secured, the player plausibly attempts to descend via the ladder, requiring the clearing of 8 mobs on Floor 1, with success dependent on encounter rates and RNG.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is dominated by local resource acquisition and safety checks rather than direct progression. The player will likely stabilize their inventory and light sources before attempting to unlock the descent. A successful transition to Floor 2 is contingent upon clearing the mob threshold on the current floor, introducing significant uncertainty regarding the exact timeline of the next major phase.

Headline: Survival stabilization and initial combat engagement on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player likely consumes a green potion to restore Health, as current levels (9.0) are low relative to the active combat loop.
2. [t+4 to t+8] With 14 Torches and sufficient Light, the player will probably move right or up to clear the immediate darkness tiles, reducing encounter randomness.
3. [t+9 to t+15] The player likely engages the Snail at (3, 0) or hunts nearby mobs to satisfy the "8 kills" requirement for the ladder_down, given the current Ladder Open status is True but mob counts are unknown.
4. [t+16+] If the Snail is defeated, the player may attempt to descend; otherwise, they will likely gather Stone or Coal to upgrade their pickaxe before descending.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on mitigating low Health and clearing local darkness to reveal safe paths. Progression hinges on defeating the visible Snail and accumulating enough kills to unlock the descent ladder, likely requiring a brief combat phase before any floor transition occurs.

3. [t+25+] Once intrinsics are stabilized and the local area is secured, the player plausibly turns back toward the ladder to descend to Floor 2, contingent on the 8-mob kill count requirement being met.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is dominated by completing the current local exploration loop and managing resource decay before committing to vertical progression. The player will likely stabilize intrinsics at the fountain and clear minor threats before attempting to descend, with exact timing dependent on encounter randomness and map layout.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state using short history context.
You are NOT given the true future trajectory.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching/using ladder_down on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, ladder_down is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
4) Core loops:
   - survival loop (stabilize intrinsics first)
   - resource loop (wood/stone/ore -> tools/weapons/armor)
   - progression loop (explore, clear threats, descend)

Note uncertainty from spawns, unseen map regions, and encounter randomness. Prefer plausible trajectories over brittle exact claims, but still make specific claims.

Forecasting style requirements:
- Use recent history to infer momentum and near-term intent.
- Stay grounded in the provided state/history.
- Mention uncertainty when appropriate (for example: "likely", "plausibly", "if no interruption").
- Be concise and information-dense: avoid repetition and filler.

Headline: Stabilization and vertical progression toward the boss threshold.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player likely moves right to the fountain at (-2, 3) to restore Drink/Energy, then gathers the 16 stones nearby to craft a Stone Pickaxe.
2. [t+5 to t+12] With the pickaxe, the player mines coal and iron ore in the immediate vicinity to upgrade the sword and craft armor, while managing decaying Food.
3. [t+13 to t+20] The player descends to Floor 2, clears the initial mob spawns (likely 4-6 enemies), and continues clearing until the 8-mob threshold is met to open the ladder_down.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future focuses on intrinsic stabilization via the fountain and rapid tool/armor upgrades using local stone and ore. Once equipped, the player will descend to Floor 2, where the primary objective is systematically killing mobs to unlock the ladder, provided no high-level boss interrupts the clear.

Headline: Local resource consolidation and torch placement likely precede deeper dungeon descent.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+12] The player likely continues moving left to clear the immediate darkness and place torches, stabilizing visibility before engaging further.
2. [t+13 to t+28] With intrinsics stable (Food/Drink > 8), intent likely shifts to gathering remaining stone/wood in the current corridor to craft additional tools or weapons.
3. [t+29+] If the corridor is cleared and no major threat interrupts, the player plausibly attempts to descend to Floor 2, contingent on the ladder mechanics triggering or being manually accessible.

Trajectory summary:
The near-term trajectory favors completing the current local loop of visibility and resource acquisition before committing to vertical progression. Momentum suggests a "setup then descend" pattern, though exact timing depends on the stochastic nature of enemy spawns and the specific requirements for opening the next ladder.

Trajectory summary:
The near-term trajectory is defined by clearing the visible Snail threats to secure the area, followed by a brief stabilization phase to restore Energy. Once stable, the primary intent shifts to descending to Floor 2, contingent on either finding an open ladder or accumulating the necessary mob kills to unlock the descent. Uncertainty exists regarding the layout of Floor 2 and the potential for high-damage encounters that could deplete Health before resources are secured.

Headline: Descent preparation likely precedes immediate floor transition due to closed ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+7 to t+15] With the ladder at (0,0) still closed, the player plausibly focuses on resource consolidation (using coal/diamonds) or minor exploration within the lit radius before attempting to kill the required mobs to open the descent.
3. [t+16+] If the mob kill count reaches the threshold (typically 8) without external interruption, the ladder likely opens, triggering a transition to Floor 3 and a shift toward deeper dungeon exploration.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate trajectory is constrained by the closed ladder at (0,0), forcing a temporary pause in vertical progression. The player will likely engage in local resource management and threat mitigation on Floor 2. Once the kill count requirement is met, the momentum will shift decisively downward to Floor 3, contingent on successful mob elimination and stable intrinsics.
