Headline: Initial wood gathering and movement toward the overworld ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+6] The player moves to the nearest tree at (-2, -2) or (-3, -3) and begins harvesting wood.
2. [t+7 to t+12] With wood in inventory, the player crafts a wooden pickaxe and wooden sword to enable basic resource collection and defense.
3. [t+13 to t+15] Since the ladder is already open on floor 0, the player begins scouting the immediate area to locate the ladder's coordinates for descent.

Trajectory summary:
The player starts in a perfect state with maxed intrinsics. The next 15 steps focus on securing basic wood tools and initiating the search for the ladder to progress to floor 1, as survival is currently stable.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Initial wood gathering and exploration for the ladder on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+6] The player moves toward the nearest trees (e.g., at (1, 1) or (-1, 2)) to begin harvesting wood, as they currently have no tools or resources.
2. [t+7 to t+12] After gathering wood, the player likely crafts a wooden pickaxe and potentially a wooden sword to prepare for basic resource extraction and defense.
3. [t+13 to t+15] Since the ladder is already open on this overworld floor, the player begins scouting the immediate area to locate the ladder's coordinates for descent.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in a strong starting position with maxed vitals. The next 15 steps will focus on obtaining the first tier of wood equipment before pivoting toward finding the ladder to progress to Floor 1.

Headline: Hunting for food and navigating to the ladder on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player moves to (1, 0) to kill the Cow, prioritizing food replenishment as the current food level is critically low (2/9).
2. [t+5 to t+8] After securing food, the player consumes it to stabilize health and prevent starvation decay.
3. [t+9 to t+15] With survival stabilized and the ladder already open, the player explores the immediate vicinity to locate and descend the ladder to Floor 1.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate priority is neutralizing the hunger threat by killing the nearby cow. Once fed, the player will bypass further resource gathering in favor of finding the open ladder to progress the floor depth.

Headline: Hunting nearby cow to restore critical food levels before floor progression.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player moves toward the cow at (1, 0) and attacks it with the iron sword to obtain food.
2. [t+5 to t+8] The player consumes the dropped meat to restore food stats, preventing health decay.
3. [t+9 to t+15] With survival stabilized, the player resumes exploration of the overworld to locate the open ladder for floor descent.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate priority is addressing the dangerously low food level (2/9). Once the cow is harvested and eaten, the player will pivot back to the primary goal of finding the ladder to descend, as the ladder is already open.

Headline: Combat and health stabilization on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves toward the Snail at (-2, 0) to engage in combat, aiming to increase the kill count for the ladder.
2. [t+6 to t+10] After defeating the Snail, the player likely consumes the Green potion or focuses on avoiding further damage to allow Health (3/9) to recover via high Food/Drink stats.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player continues exploring the right-side path and torches the darkness to locate the remaining 7 mobs required to open the ladder.

Trajectory summary:
The player is currently in a fragile state with low health but stable vitals. The immediate priority is clearing the local Snail and then cautiously exploring to trigger the ladder requirements while allowing passive health regeneration. If a more dangerous mob like an Orc Mage reappears, the player will likely retreat to a narrow corridor to fight one-on-one.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.

Headline: Navigating to the ladder and descending to Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player continues moving right and down toward the identified ladder at (0, 3).
2. [t+6 to t+8] The player reaches the ladder at (0, 3), potentially passing the fountain at (-1, 3) to top off thirst if it decays further.
3. [t+9 to t+15] The player uses the ladder to descend to Floor 2. Upon arrival, the player begins exploring the immediate vicinity of the new starting point to locate resources or enemies.

Trajectory summary:
With the ladder already open and visible, the player is in a high-momentum state to progress. The next 15 steps will likely see the player transition from Floor 1 to Floor 2, shifting focus from navigation to initial floor exploration and combat.

Headline: Navigating the dungeon corridor to descend the open ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+6] The player moves along the narrow path (0,0 to 0,4), utilizing the existing light to navigate the corridor.
2. [t+7 to t+12] As the ladder is already open, the player prioritizes exploration of the immediate dark areas at the end of the hall to locate the downward ladder.
3. [t+13 to t+15] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to Floor 2, resetting the floor-clearing requirement.

Trajectory summary:
With the ladder already open and survival stats stable, the player will bypass combat and resource gathering to focus entirely on floor progression. The next 15 steps will likely see the player transition from Floor 1 to Floor 2.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Navigating Floor 1 to locate the open ladder and descend.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player continues moving downward through the narrow corridor, exploring the revealed path.
2. [t+6 to t+10] As the ladder is already open, the player prioritizes finding its coordinates, likely moving toward unexplored regions or following existing paths.
3. [t+11 to t+15] If the ladder is located, the player moves to its tile and descends to Floor 2; otherwise, they continue probing the darkness while monitoring energy levels.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in a stable state with high health, food, and drink, but moderate energy. Since the ladder is open, the immediate goal is floor progression. The player will likely spend the next 15 steps navigating the corridors of Floor 1 to find the exit, only pausing to gather high-value resources like iron if they appear directly in the path.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state using short history context.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order:

2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If dr
