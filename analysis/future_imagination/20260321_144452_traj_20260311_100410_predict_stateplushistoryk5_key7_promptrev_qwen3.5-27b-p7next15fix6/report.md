Headline: Immediate resource gathering to enable tool crafting on Floor 0.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player moves toward the nearest tree cluster (e.g., at -2, -2 or -3, -3) and harvests wood, as the inventory currently holds zero wood and no tools.
2. [t+5 to t+9] With wood secured, the player crafts a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe, transitioning from raw gathering to tool-based mining.
3. [t+10 to t+15] The player begins mining nearby stone or coal (if visible) or explores the immediate vicinity for stone to craft a stone pickaxe, while monitoring the open ladder for potential descent once basic tools are upgraded.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are strictly focused on breaking the "zero resource" deadlock. The player will prioritize wood collection to craft a wooden pickaxe, then immediately pivot to mining stone. Since the ladder is already open, the player will likely delay descent until they possess at least a stone pickaxe to efficiently gather resources on lower floors, ensuring survival stability before progression.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate resource gathering and tool crafting on the overworld floor.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+4] The player moves toward the nearest tree (likely at 1,1 or -1,2) and harvests wood, as the inventory is empty and no tools exist.
2. [t+5 to t+8] With wood secured, the player crafts a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe to enable stone mining.
3. [t+9 to t+12] The player explores nearby tiles to locate stone deposits, prioritizing resource gathering over descending the ladder immediately.
4. [t+13 to t+15] Upon finding stone, the player mines it and begins crafting a stone pickaxe to unlock iron mining capabilities.

Trajectory summary:
Despite the ladder being open, the player's empty inventory forces a short delay in progression. The immediate future is dominated by the "Upgrade equipment" priority loop: gathering wood, crafting basic tools, and securing stone to build a foundation for deeper floor exploration.

Headline: Immediate food consumption followed by ladder descent to Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves to (1, 0) to kill the Cow, consuming the meat to raise Food from 2 to a safe level, prioritizing survival before progression.
2. [t+4 to t+8] With survival stabilized, the player navigates the open path toward the ladder (likely located nearby given the "Ladder Open: True" state on Floor 0) without engaging in resource gathering or upgrades.
3. [t+9 to t+12] The player descends the ladder to Floor 1, triggering the gain of 1 XP and resetting the immediate environment to a new dungeon floor where the ladder is initially closed.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are a rapid transition from a precarious food state to floor progression. The player will not mine or craft, as the ladder is already open and food is critically low. Once the Cow is eaten, the player will immediately descend to Floor 1 to begin the new cycle of killing troops to open the next ladder.

Headline: Immediate food acquisition from the adjacent Cow to prevent starvation.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves to (1,0) and attacks the Cow. Given the Iron Sword and low enemy count, the Cow is likely killed quickly.
2. [t+4 to t+6] The player consumes the raw meat dropped by the Cow, raising Food from 2 to a safe level (likely 5-7), stabilizing the survival metric.
3. [t+7 to t+15] With survival secured and the Ladder already open, the player scans the immediate vicinity for the ladder's location (likely near the center or a previously explored path) and moves toward it to descend to Floor 1.

Trajectory summary:
The critical constraint is the low Food stat (2), which forces an immediate kill-eat cycle before any progression can occur. Once the Cow is processed, the player's priority shifts instantly to the open ladder, as Floor 0 resources (stone, wood) are already sufficiently gathered in inventory. The next 15 steps will likely conclude with the player descending to the next floor.

Headline: Aggressive floor clearing to unlock the ladder while managing resource decay.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves from the ladder_up at (0,0) into the unexplored darkness (e.g., towards -1,1 or 1,1) to locate and engage the first of the 8 required troops, prioritizing combat over resource gathering due to the closed ladder.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player engages in combat with spawned mobs using the Iron Sword; Food and Drink stats naturally decay during this period, dropping to approximately 6 and 5 respectively, while Energy remains stable.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player continues hunting mobs to reach the kill count threshold; if a mob drops food or if a water source is encountered, the player briefly pauses to consume, otherwise they push toward the 8th kill to trigger the ladder opening.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by high-priority combat to satisfy the floor-clearing condition. With the ladder closed and survival stats currently high, the player will ignore the nearby chest and resource nodes to focus entirely on killing troops, accepting minor stat decay in exchange for rapid progression toward the next floor.

Headline: Initial exploration and resource scouting on Floor 1 to locate the descent ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves away from the entrance (0,0) into the lit corridor, likely heading East or South to scan for the first enemy spawns required to open the ladder.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player engages the first encountered troops with the Iron Sword; killing them increments the kill count toward the 8 required to open the descent ladder.
3. [t+11 to t+15] If no immediate threats block the path, the player continues exploring the visible path tiles, potentially checking the chest at (5,4) or moving toward the darkness to find more mobs, while monitoring the torch light level.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by the "Explore" phase of the algorithm. With the ladder closed and survival stats high, the player will prioritize finding and killing the 8 required troops. The presence of a chest and darkness suggests a mix of resource gathering and combat, but the primary momentum is toward clearing the floor to unlock the next descent.

Headline: Immediate health stabilization via combat and resource management on Floor 1.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player engages the Snail at (-2, 0) to secure food and potentially gain XP, as Health is critically low at 3.0 and Food is at 7.
2. [t+4 to t+8] The player consumes the Snail meat (or other gathered food) to raise Food and trigger Health regeneration, while moving away from the immediate combat zone to a safe path tile.
3. [t+9 to t+15] With Health stabilizing, the player explores the visible path network (Row 0 to Row 5, Column 0 to 5) to locate the ladder or kill additional troops to open it, prioritizing safety over deep exploration into darkness.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dominated by survival mechanics. The player must immediately convert the nearby Snail into food to arrest health decay before attempting any floor progression. Once stabilized, the focus shifts to clearing troops to open the ladder, as the current inventory (Stone Pickaxe, Iron Sword) is sufficient for basic combat but lacks the resources for further upgrades.

2. [t+4 to t+8] With the mage temporarily at range, the player prioritizes consuming the Green potion (or finding food if the potion is reserved for emergencies) to raise Health from the critical level of 3, as a single hit could be fatal.
3. [t+9 to t+15] Once health is stabilized, the player engages the nearby Snail at (-2, 0) for food or continues exploring the eastern path to locate the ladder, avoiding the western sector until the mage is dealt with or lured.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is dominated by the "Survive" priority due to the lethal combination of low Health (3) and a ranged enemy (Orc Mage). The player will likely disengage from the western combat zone to secure a health recovery before resuming floor-clearing or ladder hunting.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9.
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 after confirming open ladder status.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves from (0,0) to (0,3) to reach the open ladder, prioritizing progression over further resource gathering since survival stats are high.
2. [t+4] The player descends the ladder to Floor 2, triggering the floor transition and gaining 1 XP (total XP: 2).
3. [t+5 to t+15] Upon arriving on Floor 2, the player explores the immediate vicinity, noting that the new ladder is likely closed (requiring 8 mob kills) and begins hunting nearby troops or gathering resources to prepare for the next descent.

Trajectory summary:
The player is in a stable state with full health and high food/drink, making the open ladder the highest priority. The next 15 steps will almost certainly involve traversing to the ladder, descending to Floor 2, and initiating the "kill 8 mobs" cycle required to open the next ladder, as no immediate upgrades are needed given the current Iron Sword and sufficient resources.

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 via the open ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves from (0,0) to (0,3) to reach the `ladder_up` tile, prioritizing the open ladder over resource gathering or exploration.
2. [t+4] The player activates the ladder, descending to Floor 2. This action grants 1 XP, bringing the total to 2.
3. [t+5 to t+15] The player arrives on Floor 2, likely in a new unexplored area. The player will immediately scan for the new floor's ladder (currently closed) and nearby threats, while food and energy continue to decay slowly.

Trajectory summary:
The player's momentum is entirely focused on progression. With the ladder on Floor 1 already open and survival stats stable, the algorithm dictates immediate descent. The next 15 steps will transition from the final approach on Floor 1 to the initial exploration and threat assessment on Floor 2, where the cycle of clearing mobs to open the next ladder will begin.

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 with full stats and upgraded gear.

Meaningful events (ordered):

2. [t+4 to t+6] Upon arriving on Floor 2, the player gains 1 XP (total 2) and immediately allocates it to Strength to increase max health and melee damage, given the presence of an Iron Sword and the need for survivability on new floors.
3. [t+7 to t+15] The player begins exploring the new floor, prioritizing the location of the new descent ladder while engaging any spawned mobs to keep the ladder closed status in check (though the new ladder is initially closed, the player will start the kill count).

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by a clean transition to the next floor. With full health, food, and drink, and a functional Iron Sword, the player will descend immediately, upgrade Strength to bolster defense, and begin the cycle of exploration and mob-killing required to open the next ladder.

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 after confirming ladder accessibility.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves south along the visible path (0,-4) to (5,-4) to locate the open ladder, as the current direction is down and the ladder status is confirmed open.
2. [t+4 to t+5] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to Floor 2, triggering the gain of 1 XP.
3. [t+6 to t+10] The player arrives on Floor 2, where the new ladder is closed. With Energy at 5 (moderate), the player immediately begins exploring the new floor to locate the first 8 mobs required to open the next ladder.
4. [t+11 to t+15] The player engages in initial combat or resource gathering on Floor 2, prioritizing killing mobs over crafting upgrades since the ladder is the primary progression gate and survival stats (Health 8, Food 8, Drink 8) are currently stable.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are defined by a swift transition from Floor 1 to Floor 2. The player leverages the currently open ladder to progress, shifting focus immediately to the new floor's clearing requirements. No upgrades are performed in this window as the player possesses sufficient resources and stability to prioritize floor progression.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 via the open ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player continues moving DOWN along the visible path at column 0, approaching the ladder location which is likely adjacent or immediately ahead given the "LadderOpen=True" state and the player's downward trajectory.
2. [t+4 to t+6] Upon reaching the ladder, the player descends to Floor 2. This action triggers the gain of 1 player_xp, bringing the total to 2 XP.
3. [t+7 to t+10] On the new floor, the player pauses to assess the immediate surroundings. With Energy at 5 (moderate) and Food/Drink high, the player likely places a torch to illuminate the new area before proceeding.
4. [t+11 to t+15] The player begins exploring Floor 2, prioritizing the search for the new descent ladder. Since the new ladder is initially closed, the player will likely engage in low-risk exploration to locate resources or the first few mobs required to open it.

Trajectory summary:
The immediate future is defined by the transition to the next floor. The player's current momentum and the open ladder status make descent the highest priority. Once on Floor 2, the focus shifts to securing visibility and beginning the cycle of exploration and mob hunting required to open the next ladder.

Headline: Immediate ascent to Floor 0 to secure survival and resources.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+3] The player moves left to (0, -1) and ascends the open ladder to Floor 0, prioritizing escape from the immediate threat of multiple Orc Mages and Fireballs on Floor 1.
2. [t+4 to t+8] Upon reaching Floor 0, the player locates the nearest food source (likely a Snail or animal) to restore Health from 4.0, as low health prevents safe re-engagement with Floor 1 enemies.
3. [t+9 to t+15] With Health stabilized, the player gathers nearby wood or stone on Floor 0 to craft a crafting table or furnace if missing, preparing to utilize the single Diamond in inventory for a Diamond Pickaxe upgrade.

Trajectory summary:
The next 15 steps are dictated by the "Survive" priority. The player cannot safely clear Floor 1 with Health at 4.0 and multiple enemies nearby. The immediate trajectory involves ascending to the safer overworld (Floor 0) to recover health and food, then transitioning to equipment upgrades using the existing Diamond before attempting to return to Floor 1.

Headline: Immediate descent to Floor 2 via the open ladder.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+2] The player moves from (0,0) to (0,-1) to reach the `ladder_up` tile, which serves as the exit to the next floor since `LadderOpen` is True.
2. [t+3] The player activates the ladder, transitioning from Floor 1 to Floor 2. This action consumes one step and grants 1 XP, likely triggering an attribute upgrade decision (Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence).
3. [t+4 to t+15] Upon arrival on Floor 2, the player immediately begins exploring the new map generation to locate the new descent ladder, while managing low Health (4) and avoiding immediate combat with unknown spawns.

Trajectory summary:
The player's priority is strictly progression because the ladder is already open. With survival stats (Food, Drink, Energy) stable enough for a short burst of activity, the player will bypass resource gathering or combat on Floor 1 to descend immediately. The next 15 steps will be dominated by the transition to Floor 2 and the initial reconnaissance of the new level.

The player's current state is optimal for progression: full stats, high-tier tools (Diamond Pickaxe), and an open ladder. The immediate future is dominated by the transition to the next floor. Once on Floor 2, the goal shifts instantly from "descend" to "clear mobs" to reopen the ladder, while leveraging the diamond pickaxe to mine any encountered resources efficiently.

Headline: Aggressive floor clearing to unlock the descent ladder on Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player immediately explores the visible path network (columns -4 to 4) to locate and engage the first available troops, as the ladder is currently closed.
2. [t+6 to t+10] The player continues hunting mobs to reach the required kill count of 8, utilizing the Diamond Pickaxe to clear any stalagmites (at 2,-1 and 2,4) if they obstruct movement or hide resources.
3. [t+11 to t+15] Upon reaching 8 kills, the ladder opens; the player navigates to the ladder's location and descends to Floor 3, triggering a new floor transition and gaining 1 XP.

Trajectory summary:
With full stats and high-tier tools, the player is in a stable position to prioritize progression. The immediate future is defined by a focused combat loop to satisfy the floor-clearing requirement, followed by a descent to the next level. No resource gathering or crafting is expected in this window unless the player encounters a specific resource node while hunting.

You are forecasting a plausible future for a Craftax state.

Craftax overview:
Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies.

Use these game rules:
1) Coordinates are (Row, Column), centered on the player at (0,0).
   - Negative Row = UP, Positive Row = DOWN.
   - Negative Column = LEFT, Positive Column = RIGHT.
2) Intrinsics: Health, Food, Drink, Energy, Mana. All out of 9. 
   - Food/Drink/Energy naturally decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy reaches 0, Health tends to decay.
   - If Food/Drink/Energy are maintained, Health can recover.
3) Floor progression uses ladders.
   - Descending requires reaching the ladder on the current floor.
   - On non-overworld floors, the ladder is generally closed until enough mobs on that floor are killed (typically 8), then it opens.
   - After taking a ladder down, the player will be on a new floor. That ladder will remain and can be used to ascend back to the previous floor, but is different from the ladder that the player must find to descend further.

Here is a good algorithm the player will play the game by:
At every step, the player should act with the goal of staying alive and progressing down floors. This means the player will choose the highest-priority active goal in this order: 
1. Survive
2. Take the ladder if it is open
3. Upgrade equipment if survival is stable
4. Explore to find resources, troops, and the ladder
1. Survive
The player must track health, food, drink, and energy.  If food is low, get food immediately by killing animals and eating them.  If drink is low, get drink immed

Headline: Immediate exploration and mob hunting to unlock the descent ladder on Floor 2.

Meaningful events (ordered):
1. [t+1 to t+5] The player moves away from the ladder_up (0,0) into the unexplored darkness, likely placing a torch to reveal the map and scanning for the first enemy to kill.
2. [t+6 to t+10] Upon encountering a mob (likely a Snail or similar low-tier troop given the floor depth), the player engages and defeats it using the Iron Sword, incrementing the kill count toward the ladder's opening threshold.
3. [t+11 to t+15] The player continues exploring the revealed path segments, hunting for a second or third enemy to accelerate the ladder opening process, while maintaining full stats (Health/Food/Drink/Energy) to avoid forced retreats.

Trajectory summary:
The player has just descended to Floor 2 where the ladder is closed. With full stats and strong equipment (Iron Sword, Diamond Pickaxe), the immediate priority is aggressive exploration to find and kill the 8 required troops. The next 15 steps will focus on mapping the immediate area, engaging the first few enemies, and building momentum toward opening the ladder, with no need for resource gathering or sleeping given the current high intrinsics.
