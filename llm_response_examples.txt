You are playing Craftax.

Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies. The player can move in the four cardinal directions and can interact. Interacting can cause the player to attempt to mine (a block), attack (a creature), drink (water or from a fountain), eat (fruit) or open a chest. This interaction will only happen if the block/creature/chest is directly in front of the player, one step in the direction the player is facing. 
The player has 5 'intrinsics': health, hunger, thirst, energy and mana (magical energy). Hunger, thirst and energy will naturally decrease and must be replenished by eating, drinking and sleeping respectively. Mana is used for casting spells or enchanting items and will naturally recover. Health will recover when hunger, thirst and energy are non-zero and will decrease if any of these are 0. If the players health falls beneath 0 they will die and the game will restart.

IMPORTANT: To progress through the game the player needs to find the ladder on each floor, which can be used to descend to the next level. Each floor possesses unique challenges and creatures, increasing in difficulty until the final boss level. The ladders begin closed and the player must kill 8 creatures on each level to open up the respective ladders (with the exception of the overworld). There are 9 levels in total.

Here is a rough outline of an example progression of this game:
- Gather wood from nearby trees to build a crafting table and then wood tools
- Find and mine stones to make stone tools or place as a furnace or stone
- Use your tools to mine iron ore and coal to use for building iron tools and armor, and make sure to collect extra coal and wood to use as torches later in the game
- The ladder is always open on the overworld, but once you have iron tools and torches you should be ready to descend. Traverse the overworld looking for the ladder and descend.
- Continue killing creatures, then finding and descending down ladders

Make sure to stay healthy during this process, killing cows (or that level's equivalent peaceful animal), drinking water, and resting enough to keep the intrinsics above 0.

Good reasoning: "My inventory has 0 Wood, which is the first resource I need to start crafting. I see a tree located at (-3, 2). I am currently at (0, 0). Thus the tree is 3 steps up and 2 steps right. What is one step up? (-1, 0) is grass. Ok, so I should step up to get closer to the tree."
Good action: 3 (UP)

Good reasoning: "My health is very low (3.0), so I am in danger of dying. There is a Zombie at (0, 1), which is directly to my right. I am at (0, 0). The zombie is at (0, 1) and therefore adjacent and dangerous. If I fight with only 3 health, I might die. I should escape. Looking around: (0, -1) is grass to my left, (-1, 0) is grass above, (1, 0) is grass below. I should move away from the zombie. Going down (action 4) will take me to (1, 0) which is grass and away from danger."
Good action: 4 (DOWN)

Good reasoning: "I have 2 Wood in my inventory. I need 2 wood to place a crafting table. Looking at my current position (0, 0), I can see there's a stone at (1, -3) and cows nearby at (-1, 1) and (0, 2). I have enough wood now to place a crafting table. This is the first step in the progression: place table → craft wood pickaxe → mine stone → make stone tools. I should place a crafting table here. Action 8 is PLACE_TABLE."
Good action: 8 (PLACE_TABLE)

current game state. I'm at position (0,0). The map shows what's around me.

From the map data:

- At (0, -1): tree
- At (-1, 0): tree
- At (1, 0): grass
- At (0, 1): grass
- At (1, 1): grass
- Etc.

Also, inventory has Wood:1, which is good because wood is a basic resource. I need to start crafting tools to mine more resources.

The player has 1 wood in inventory. In the examples, they used wood to make tools. For instance, in EXAMPLE 3, they had 2 wood and placed a crafting table.

But here, I have only 1 wood. I need to get more wood to make a crafting table.

What's around me? I'm at (0,0). Let me see what's directly in front of me since I can interact only with what's directly in front.

Direction is "up", which is (-1, 0) in the coordinate system (up is negative y? Wait, no.

Important: up is (-1, 0), down is (1, 0), left is (0, -1), right is (0, 1).

In the game description: "up is (-1, 0), down is (1, 0), left is (0, -1), and right is (0, 1)."

So, from (0,0):

- Up: (0-1, 0) = (-1, 0)
- Down: (0+1, 0) = (1, 0)
- Left: (0, 0-1) = (0, -1)
- Right: (0, 0+1) = (0, 1)

Now, looking at the map:

- (-1, 0): grass? Wait, let's check the map.

The map is given as:

For y=-4 to y=4, x from -5 to 5.

At (x,y):

- (0, -1): tree (from the map: "0, -1: tree")

In the map list:

-5, -4: grass
-4, -4: sand
... 
0, -4: water
1, -4: water
...
-5, -3: grass
...
0, -3: sand
...
-5, -2: grass
...
0, -2: grass
...
-5, -1: grass
...
0, -1: tree
...
-5, 0: grass
...
0, 0: grass
...
-5, 1: grass
...
0, 1: grass
...
-5, 2: grass
...
0, 2: grass
...
-5, 3: grass
...
0, 3: tree
...
-5, 4: grass
...
0, 4: grass

So at (0,0): grass (from "0, 0: grass")

(0,1): grass

(0,-1): tree (from "0, -1: tree")

(-1,0): grass? Let's see: the map says "-1, 0: tree" for x=-1, y=0? Wait no.

In the map description:

It says: "-5, 0: grass", "-4, 0: grass", "-3, 0: grass", "-2, 0: grass", "-1, 0: tree", "0, 0: grass", "1, 0: grass", etc.

So:

- At (x, y) = (-1, 0): tree
- At (x, y) = (0, 0): grass
- At (x, y) = (1, 0): grass

Similarly, for y=1: "-1, 1: grass", "0, 1: grass", "1, 1: grass"

Now, since my direction is "up", which is (-1, 0), so the cell directly in front of me is (-1, 0), which is a tree.

The map says: "-1, 0: tree" so at position (-1, 0) there is a tree.

In the game, trees can be mined for wood. I have 1 wood in inventory, but I need to mine more to craft tools.

I should look for a way to get more wood. Trees are good sources of wood.

Currently, I'm at (0,0), facing up, so (-1,0) is directly in front and it's a tree.

I can interact with it to mine wood.

The action "5:DO" is for interact/mine/attack. Since it's a tree, I can mine it for wood.

But I need to be careful: mining a tree gives wood, but I have to do it properly.

In the examples, when they moved to a tree, they used the map to plan.

Here, directly in front is a tree at (-1,0).

So, I should do a DO action to mine that tree.

But let's check if that's the best move.

Also, I have low drink: 7, which might be a problem soon, but health and food are okay.

Food:8, Drink:7, so I should probably drink something soon to avoid dehydration.

But I don't have any potions in inventory. Inventory shows all potions are 0.

Red potion:0, etc. So I can't drink a potion.

The only way to get water is to find a water source.

In the map, there are water blocks.

For example, at (0,-4): water, (1,-4): water, etc.

But to drink water, I need to be at a water block and interact with it.

The action for drinking water is probably part of DO, but in the actions list, drinking is listed as "35:READ_BOOK" or others? Wait.

Let's see the actions:

Actions available: 0:NOOP, 1:LEFT, 2:RIGHT, 3:UP, 4:DOWN, 5:DO (interact/mine/attack), 6:SLEEP, 7:PLACE_STONE, ... etc.

DO is the interact action. If I do DO on a water block, it should drink water.

Similarly, for a tree, DO mines wood.

In this case, at (-1,0), it's a tree, so DO should mine wood.

But I have 1 wood already, so after mining, I'll have 2 wood.

Then I can make a wood pickaxe.

First, I need a crafting table.

In the examples, they placed a table first.

Here, I have only 1 wood, so I can't place a table yet because a table requires 2 wood (from the examples).

In EXAMPLE 3, they had 2 wood and placed a table.

So with 1 wood, I need to mine another tree to get 2 wood.

Currently, I'm at (0,0), facing up, so (-1,0) is tree.

I should mine that tree to get wood.

After that, I'll have 2 wood, then I can place a table.

But to place a table, I need to be at a position where I can place it, and I need to have the table item.

The action "8:PLACE_TABLE" is for placing a table, but I need to have the crafting table in my inventory? Wait no.

In the game, when you place a table, you need to have the wood to make it, but in Craftax, I think you place the table using the craft action.

Let's think.

From the actions: 8 is PLACE_TABLE, which probably means you place a table block in the world.

But to do that, you need to have the materials? In the examples, they didn't have the table in inventory; they placed it after having wood.

In EXAMPLE 3, they had wood in inventory and placed the table.

The action "PLACE_TABLE" might be the action to place a table block, which requires wood.

But in the game mechanics, when you place a table, you use wood from inventory.

Similarly, for mining.

In this context, since I have 1 wood, and I'm at (0,0), I should move to mine a tree.

The tree is directly in front: (-1,0) is tree.

So action 5 (DO) should mine it.

After mining, I get 1 more wood, so wood becomes 2.

Then I can place a table.

But to place a table, I need to be at a position where I can place it, and I need to have the action to place it.

Also, the map has grass and trees, so I can move around.

Another thing: the ladder is open on floor 0 (overworld), but I need to descend later. For now, I should focus on gathering resources.

In the inventory, I have food:8, drink:7, so I should drink water to increase drink.

But to drink water, I need to be at a water block.

Where is water? From the map:

- At (0,-4): water
- (1,-4): water, etc.
- Also at (2,-3): water, (3,-3): water, etc.

But I'm at (0,0), which is grass. To get to water, I need to move.

The water blocks are at y=-4 to y=-2 or so, but I'm at y=0.

Let's see the y
Time is up.

Given the time I've spent and the approaches I've tried, I should stop thinking and formulate a final answer based on what I already have.
</think>

Action: 5 (DO)  
**Reasoning**: I am at (0,0) facing up (direction: up), so the cell directly in front of me at (-1, 0) is a tree. Since I have only 1 wood in my inventory and need at least 2 wood to place a crafting table (as shown in the examples), mining this tree will give me 1 more wood (total 2 wood). With 2 wood, I can immediately place a crafting table to start crafting tools for mining stone and progressing toward the next steps. This is the most efficient use of my current position and resources to advance

You are playing Craftax.

Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies. The player can move in the four cardinal directions and can interact. Interacting can cause the player to attempt to mine (a block), attack (a creature), drink (water or from a fountain), eat (fruit) or open a chest. This interaction will only happen if the block/creature/chest is directly in front of the player, one step in the direction the player is facing. 
The player has 5 'intrinsics': health, hunger, thirst, energy and mana (magical energy). Hunger, thirst and energy will naturally decrease and must be replenished by eating, drinking and sleeping respectively. Mana is used for casting spells or enchanting items and will naturally recover. Health will recover when hunger, thirst and energy are non-zero and will decrease if any of these are 0. If the players health falls beneath 0 they will die and the game will restart.

IMPORTANT: To progress through the game the player needs to find the ladder on each floor, which can be used to descend to the next level. Each floor possesses unique challenges and creatures, increasing in difficulty until the final boss level. The ladders begin closed and the player must kill 8 creatures on each level to open up the respective ladders (with the exception of the overworld). There are 9 levels in total.

Here is a rough outline of an example progression of this game:
- Gather wood from nearby trees to build a crafting table and then wood tools
- Find and mine stones to make stone tools or place as a furnace or stone
- Use your tools to mine iron ore and coal to use for building iron tools and armor, and make sure to collect extra coal and wood to use as torches later in the game
- The ladder is always open on the overworld, but once you have iron tools and torches you should be ready to descend. Traverse the overworld looking for the ladder and descend.
- Continue killing creatures, then finding and descending down ladders

Make sure to stay healthy during this process, killing cows (or that level's equivalent peaceful animal), drinking water, and resting enough to keep the intrinsics above 0.

Good reasoning: "My inventory has 0 Wood, which is the first resource I need to start crafting. I see a tree located at (-3, 2). I am currently at (0, 0). Thus the tree is 3 steps up and 2 steps right. What is one step up? (-1, 0) is grass. Ok, so I should step up to get closer to the tree."

Good reasoning: "My health is very low (3.0), so I am in danger of dying. There is a Zombie at (0, 1), which is directly to my right. I am at (0, 0). The zombie is at (0, 1) and therefore adjacent and dangerous. If I fight with only 3 health, I might die. I should escape. Looking around: (0, -1) is grass to my left, (-1, 0) is grass above, (1, 0) is grass below. I should move away from the zombie.

Next full response:
"""
current game state. I'm at position (0,0) based on the map description and the "You are at (0,0)" statement. The map shows the terrain around me.

Let me parse the map to see what's directly in front of me, since I can only interact with things one step in the direction I'm facing. My direction is "up", which according to the problem statement: up is (-1, 0). So from (0,0), up would be (-1, 0).

In the map, the coordinates are given as (x, y), I think. Let me confirm the coordinate system.

The problem says: "up is (-1, 0), down is (1, 0), left is (0, -1), and right is (0, 1)."

So, in the map, the first number is x, the second is y? Looking at the examples, like (-3,2) for a tree, it's probably (x,y) with x increasing to the right and y increasing up? But in the problem, it says "up is (-1,0)", which means decreasing x if y is the vertical axis.

I need to be careful.

In the map description, it's listed as "x, y" for each cell. For example, "-5,-4: grass" means x=-5, y=-4.

And from the movement: up is (-1, 0), so moving up decreases the x-coordinate? Let's see.

In the example states, when they say "I am at (0,0)", and they move up to (-1,0), which is a grass cell.

In the first example: "I am currently at (0, 0). Thus the tree is 3 steps up and 2 steps right."

"Up" means decreasing x? Because from (0,0) to (-1,0) is up.

In the coordinate system, x is horizontal, y is vertical? But in the problem, it says "up is (-1, 0)", so the vector for up is (-1, 0), meaning x decreases by 1, y stays the same? That might be inconsistent.

Let me read the problem carefully.

"Important: up is (-1, 0), down is (1, 0), left is (0, -1), and right is (0, 1)."

So, in terms of grid coordinates:

- Moving up: (x, y) -> (x - 1, y)

- Moving down: (x, y) -> (x + 1, y)

- Moving left: (x, y) -> (x, y - 1)

- Moving right: (x, y) -> (x, y + 1)

But in the map, the cells are listed with x and y, like (-5,-4) for grass.

In the map, y might be the vertical axis, with negative y being lower? But in the description, it says "water" at (0,-4), (1,-4), etc., and "grass" at higher y.

I think I should assume that in the map, the second number is y, and it increases as we go "up" in the game sense? But the problem defines up as (-1,0), which is decreasing x.

This is confusing. Let me look at the examples for clarity.

In the first example: "I am at (0, 0). Tree at (-3, 2). So from (0,0) to (-3,2) is 3 left and 2 up? But up is (-1,0), so moving up decreases x.

In the map, the coordinates are given with negative numbers for lower parts? Let's see the map values.

In the current state, at (0,0): it's grass, from the map: "0, 0: grass"

Also, from the map:

-1, 0: tree (from the list: "-1, 0: tree")

0, 0: grass

1, 0: grass

So at (0,0), I'm on grass.

My direction is "up", which means I'm facing towards decreasing x.

So the cell directly in front of me (up) is (-1, 0).

From the map: "-1, 0: tree"

So I have a tree at (-1, 0) directly in front of me.

Similarly, other directions:

- Left: (0, -1) — from map: "0, -1: grass" (since "-1, -1: grass" is x=-1,y=-1? Let's list all.

The map is given as pairs: "x, y: type"

For example: "-5, -4: grass" so x=-5, y=-4

In the list: "0, -1: grass" — that's x=0, y=-1

Similarly, "1, -1: grass" etc.

In the current state, at (0,0), I'm facing up (direction up).

So the cell directly in front (one step up) is (x-1, y) = (-1, 0)

From the map: "-1, 0: tree" — so there's a tree at (-1, 0)

Also, the map shows: "-1, 0: tree" so yes.

Now, I have inventory: Wood: 2, Stone: 0, etc.

I need to think about what to do.

The goal is to progress through the game. Since I'm on floor 0, and ladder is open, I should start by gathering resources.

I have wood in inventory (2), but I don't have a crafting table yet. To craft tools, I need a table.

In the examples, they placed tables when they had wood.

Here, I have wood, but no table.

Also, I have some hunger (Food:8), thirst (Drink:7), energy (8), all above 0, so health should be fine.

But I need to find a tree to get more wood? I already have wood, but I might need to mine or something.

First, since I have wood, I should consider making a crafting table to craft tools.

To place a crafting table, I need to be at a position where I can do it, but the action "PLACE_TABLE" requires me to be at a cell that can have a table, I think. But in the game, I can place items on the ground.

In the examples, they placed tables at their current position.

For instance, in example 3, they had wood and placed a table at (0,0).

Similarly here.

I am at (0,0), which is grass, so I can place a table there.

But to place a table, I need the action 8: PLACE_TABLE.

The inventory has wood:2, but to place a table, I need wood? No, the crafting table is a separate item; I think the wood is used for crafting, but to place the table, I don't need wood from inventory; I need to have the table item, but in this game, crafting tables are placed on the ground, and they consume wood to make items? I need to clarify.

From the actions: 8 is PLACE_TABLE, which probably places a crafting table on the ground at my position.

In the inventory, wood is listed, but for placing a table, I don't consume wood; I use the table to craft things later.

In the examples, when they placed a table, they had wood in inventory, but placing the table doesn't use wood; it's the crafting action that uses wood.

For instance, in example 3: "I have 2 Wood in my inventory. I need 2 wood to place a crafting table." — wait, that says "I need 2 wood to place a crafting table"? That might be a mistake.

Let's read example 3 carefully.

"Good reasoning: 'I have 2 Wood in my inventory. I need 2 wood to place a crafting table.'"

But in reality, placing a crafting table doesn't consume wood; it's a block you place. The wood is for crafting items.

I think there might be confusion.

In the game, a crafting table is a block that you place, and it doesn't require wood to be placed; you just place it. Then, to make items, you use wood from inventory.

In the example, it says "I need 2 wood to place a crafting table" — that seems incorrect.

Perhaps in this game, the crafting table is made from wood, so you need to craft it first? But that doesn't make sense because in most games, you place a table to craft.

Let's look at the action list: 8:PLACE_TABLE, and it's not listed under crafting actions; it's a placement action.

Also, in the inventory, there is "Sapling" which might be for trees, but not for tables.

I should infer from the context.

In the first example, they moved to a tree to get wood, but they didn't have wood initially.

In this state, I have wood:2, so I can potentially make a pickaxe or something.

But to craft, I need a crafting table.

The key point is: to place a crafting table, I need to have the table item, but I don't have it; I have wood.

In the game, crafting tables are placed by the player using the action, and they don't consume resources at placement time; the resources are consumed when crafting.

For instance, in Minecraft-like games, you place a crafting table block, and then you use materials to craft items.

So,
Time is up.

Given the time I've spent and the approaches I've tried, I should stop thinking and formulate a final answer based on what I already have.
</think>

Action: 8 (PLACE_TABLE)  

**Reasoning**: I am at (0,0) with 2 units of wood in my inventory. To progress, I need a crafting table to craft tools (like a wood pickaxe) for mining resources. Since I have enough wood to place the table (the game requires 2 wood for crafting tables, as implied by the examples), I should immediately place it here. This is the first step in the progression outlined in the examples—placing the table enables me to craft basic tools, which are essential for mining stone and progressing further. I have sufficient health, hunger, and energy (Food:
