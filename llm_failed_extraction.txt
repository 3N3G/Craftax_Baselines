You are playing Craftax.

Craftax is a game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting and fighting enemies. The player can move in the four cardinal directions and can interact. Interacting can cause the player to attempt to mine (a block), attack (a creature), drink (water or from a fountain), eat (fruit) or open a chest. This interaction will only happen if the block/creature/chest is directly in front of the player, one step in the direction the player is facing. 
The player has 5 'intrinsics': health, hunger, thirst, energy and mana (magical energy). Hunger, thirst and energy will naturally decrease and must be replenished by eating, drinking and sleeping respectively. Mana is used for casting spells or enchanting items and will naturally recover. Health will recover when hunger, thirst and energy are non-zero and will decrease if any of these are 0. If the players health falls beneath 0 they will die and the game will restart.

To progress through the game the player needs to find the ladder on each floor, which can be used to descend to the next level. Each floor possesses unique challenges and creatures, increasing in difficulty until the final boss level. The ladders begin closed and the player must kill 8 creatures on each level to open up the respective ladders (with the exception of the overworld). There are 9 levels in total.

Here is a rough outline of an example progression of this game:
- Gather wood from nearby trees to build a crafting table and then wood tools
- Find and mine stones to make stone tools or place as a furnace or stone
- Use your tools to mine iron ore and coal to use for building iron tools and armor, and make sure to collect extra coal and wood to use as torches later in the game
- The ladder is always open on the overworld, but once you have iron tools and torches you should be ready to descend. Traverse the overworld looking for the ladder and descend.
- Continue killing creatures, then finding and descending down ladders

Make sure to stay healthy during this process, killing cows (or that level's equivalent peaceful animal), drinking water, and resting enough to keep the intrinsics above 0.

### COORDINATE & INTERACTION RULES
1. Matrix Coordinates: The map uses (Row, Column) notation.
   - ROW (1st number): Vertical. Negative is UP, Positive is DOWN.
   - COL (2nd number): Horizontal. Negative is LEFT, Positive is RIGHT.
   - Example: From (0,0), moving UP goes to (-1, 0). Moving DOWN goes to (1, 0).

2. Interaction Targets: The 'DO' action only affects the block you are FACING.
   - If facing UP: You act on (Row-1, Col)
   - If facing DOWN: You act on (Row+1, Col)
   - If facing LEFT: You act on (Row, Col-1)
   - If facing RIGHT: You act on (Row, Col+1)

### IMPORTANT: GROUNDING REQUIREMENT
Before planning your move, you should explicitly check ONLY THE CURRENT MAP observation for:
1. Your immediate neighbors: (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), and (-1,0)
2. The specific objects you are targeting
Do NOT reference coordinates from the examples - only from the CURRENT GAME STATE.

Below are examples of good gameplay decisions. These are EXAMPLES ONLY, not your actual game history:

--- EXAMPLE 1 ---
Game State:
Map (interesting tiles only): 1, 0:crafting_table, 2, -3:tree, 4, 0:stone, 5, 0:stone
Inventory:
Wood: 3
...
Health: 9.0
Food: 9
Drink: 9
Energy: 9
Mana: 9
Direction: right
...
<think> I have full health. I am not hungry. I am not thirsty. I am not tired. I have 3 Wood and I need to craft tools. I see a crafting table already here!
1. Scan Map: Found 'crafting_table' at (1, 0).
2. Calculate Position:
   - Target (1, 0) - Me (0,0) = (+1 Row, 0 Col).
   - +1 Row is DOWN.
3. Orientation Check: My Direction is 'right'. I need to face 'down' to interact.
4. Plan: I must turn or move. Since it is adjacent, I can just interact if I face it. Wait, I am not facing it. I should move towards it or turn. Actually, if I move DOWN I will stand on top of it? No, it's a solid block probably.
   - Better option: I will make my own table? No, I see one.
   - Let's correct: If I want to place a table, I check if one exists. One exists.
   - I will Interact. But I am facing Right. So I will turn down to face the table
</think>
**Action:** 3 (TURN_DOWN)
   

--- EXAMPLE 2 ---
Game State:
Map (interesting tiles only): 0, -3:tree, 1, 3:stone
Inventory:
Wood: 0
...
Direction: right
...
<think>
I have full health. I am not hungry. I am not thirsty. I have 0 Wood. I need to find a tree to gather wood. Scanning the map...
1. Scan Map: Found 'tree' at (0, -3).
2. Calculate Position:
   - Target: (0, -3)
   - Me: (0, 0)
   - Delta: (0 Row, -3 Col).
   - Analysis: Same row, 3 steps LEFT.
3. Plan: The tree is to my WEST (Left). I am facing EAST (Right). I need to walk over there to chop it.
   - First step: Move LEFT.
</think>
**Action:** 1 (LEFT)

--- EXAMPLE 3 ---
Game State:
Map (interesting tiles only): 0, -2:water, 3, -4:tree, -3, -3:tree, 4, -3:Skeleton on grass
Inventory:
...
Health: 4.0
Food: 5
Drink: 4
...
Direction: down
...
<think>
I am thirsty (Drink: 4). I have low health (4/10). I need to recover health, so I need to eat and drink water. There is water nearby. The skeleton is far away, so I don't need to worry about it.
1. Scan Map: Found 'water' at (0, -2).
2. Calculate Position:
   - Target (0, -2). Me (0, 0).
   - Delta: (0, -2).
   - Analysis: 2 steps LEFT.
3. Plan: This is a simple situation with a clear single objective: reach the water. No threats nearby. I will move LEFT.
</think>
**Action:** 1 (LEFT)

--- EXAMPLE 4 ---
Game State:
Map (interesting tiles only): 0, 2:Arrow , 0, 3:Skeleton, 1, 1:Cow
Inventory:
Wood: 0
...
Health: 3.0
...
Direction: right
...
<think>
I am in critical condition (Health: 3.0). I am hungry. I see a Skeleton to my East shooting at me! There is an Arrow incoming at (0, 2).
1. Analyze Threats:
   - 'Arrow' at (0, 2). It is on my row (Row 0). It will hit me if I stay or move East/West in this row.
   - 'Skeleton' at (0, 3).
2. Analyze Resources:
   - 'Cow' at (1, 1). This is food/healing.
3. Calculate Position:
   - Me: (0, 0).
   - Arrow: (0, 2).
   - Cow: (1, 1).
4. Strategic Decision:
   - I MUST dodge the arrow immediately. I cannot fight (health too low).
   - Moving DOWN (to 1, 0) takes me to Row 1, safely out of the arrow's path (Row 0).
   - Moving DOWN also places me at (1, 0), which is adjacent to the Cow at (1, 1).
   - This achieves two goals: Dodge the threat AND approach healing.
5. Plan: Move DOWN.
</think>
**Action:** 3 (DOWN)

--- EXAMPLE 5 ---
Game State:
Map (interesting tiles only): 1, 0:Orc Soldier on torch on path, 4, 0:Snail on path
Inventory:
Wood: 17
Iron: 4
Stone: 61
Iron Sword with No enchantment
Iron Helmet with No enchantment
...
Health: 6.3
Food: 3
...
Direction: down
...
<think>
I have decent health (6.3). I am hungry. I am not thirsty. I am not tired. There is an Orc Soldier one tile below me. I have Iron gear (Sword, Armor). I am confident I can win.
1. Scan Map: 'Orc Soldier' at (1, 0).
2. Calculate Position:
   - Target (1, 0) - Me (0, 0) = (+1 Row, 0 Col).
   - Analysis: The enemy is 1 step DOWN.
3. Orientation Check: My Direction is 'down'.
   - Result: I am facing the enemy.
4. Strategy: Fight. I have armor and a sword. I need to kill 8 enemies to open the ladder. I probably will not die because I have armor and a sword. I will attack to clear the path and potentially get loot.
Action: DO (Attack).
</think>
**Action:** 5 (DO)

Full Response:

First, I need to understand the current game state. The map shows water at various positions: (2,-4), (3,-4), (4,-4), (5,-4), (4,-3), (5,-3). Also, there are trees at (1,0), (2,1), (3,1), and a stone at (-4,-3). I'm at (0,0) with direction up.

My inventory is empty except for health, food, drink, energy, and mana all at 9.0, which is full. I have no wood, stone, coal, iron, etc. So I need to start gathering resources.

The water is all in the negative column (left side) and rows 2-5. Since I'm at (0,0) facing up (negative row direction), I should check what's directly in front of me.

From the coordinate rules:
- Row: Negative is UP, Positive is DOWN.
- Col: Negative is LEFT, Positive is RIGHT.

I'm at (0,0), facing UP. So the tile directly in front of me is (Row-1, Col) = (-1, 0). But the map doesn't show anything at (-1,0). The map only lists "interesting tiles," so probably (-1,0) is empty or not relevant.

Looking at the map: it shows water at (2,-4), (3,-4), etc., but not near (0,0). The closest water is at (2,-4), which is row 2 (down), col -4 (left). Since I'm at (0,0), to get to water, I need to move left or down.

My direction is up, so I'm facing row -1 (up from row 0).

But in the map, there are trees at (1,0), (2,1), (3,1). (1,0) is row 1 (down from row 0), col 0 (same as me). So directly below me is (1,0), which is a tree.

Let me list the immediate neighbors to check for interaction:

- Up: (Row-1, Col) = (-1, 0) — not listed in map, so probably empty or not interesting.
- Down: (Row+1, Col) = (1, 0) — map shows "1, 0:tree", so there's a tree there.
- Left: (Row, Col-1) = (0, -1) — not listed, so probably empty.
- Right: (Row, Col+1) = (0, 1) — not listed, so empty.

The map says: "1, 0:tree" — that means row 1, column 0. Since row 1 is down from row 0, it's directly below me.

I'm at (0,0), facing up. But the tree is at (1,0), which is down from me.

For interaction: the "DO" action only works if the target is directly in front of me. Since I'm facing up, the target would be at (-1,0), but there's no tile there listed.

The map has "1, 0:tree" — that's row 1, col 0. To interact with that tree, I need to be facing it.

Currently, I'm facing up (direction: up), so I'm not facing the tree at (1,0). To interact with the tree, I need to turn or move to face it.

In the examples, they often check the immediate neighbors to see what I can do.

From the state: I have no wood, so I need to find a tree to chop for wood.

The map shows trees at (1,0), (2,1), (3,1). (1,0) is closest to me.

I should move towards the trees to get wood.

Since I'm facing up, I should turn to face down to see the tree below me.

In example 2, when the tree was to the left, they moved left.

Here, the tree is directly below me (down direction).

My direction is up, so to face down, I need to turn down.

Action: TURN_DOWN (id 3) would change my direction to down.

After turning down, I'm facing (1,0), which is the tree.

Then I can interact with it.

I have full health, food, drink, energy, mana — all 9, so I don't need to do anything else yet. Just need to gather wood.

The goal is to build a crafting table and tools.

First, I need wood. So I should chop the tree at (1,0).

But to interact with it, I need to be facing it.

Currently, I'm at (0,0), facing up. Tree at (1,0) is down from me.

So step 1: turn down to face the tree.

Action: 3 (TURN_DOWN)

After that, I'm facing down, so the tree is directly in front of me.

Then I can do DO (interact) to chop the tree.

But in the action list, DO is action 5, which is "interact/mine/attack". Since it's a tree, it should be mined for wood.

The game says: "Interacting can cause the player to attempt to mine (a block), attack (a creature), drink (water or from a fountain), eat (fruit) or open a chest."

For trees, mining should give wood.

In the inventory, I have Wood: 0, so after mining, I should get wood.

Also, the water is there, but I don't need water right now since I have full drink.

I should prioritize getting wood to build tools.

Let me see if there are other resources.

The water is at (2,-4), etc., but that's far left. I'm at (0,0), so to get there, I need to move left first.

But trees are closer: (1,0) is one step down.

So best first step: turn down to face the tree.

In the coordinate system, row: negative up, positive down. So from (0,0), down is row 1.

Map says: "1, 0:tree" — row 1, col 0.

Yes.

So internal reasoning:

- I am at (0,0), facing up.
- The tree at (1,0) is directly below me (down direction).
- To interact with it, I need to face down.
- Turning down will make the tree the target for interaction.
- I have no wood, so I need to chop a tree to get wood for crafting.

Therefore, action: TURN_DOWN (id 3)

After turning down, I can do DO to mine the tree.

But for now, the immediate action is to turn down.

In the examples, they output the action right away.

For instance, in example 1, they turned down.

Similarly, here.

I should not move yet; turning is the first step.

Also, the map shows multiple trees, but the closest is (1,0).

Is there anything else I should check?

Health is 9, food 9, etc., all full, so no immediate need to recover.

No threats mentioned in the state.

So, action should be TURN_DOWN.

Confirm the action IDs:

1: LEFT

2: RIGHT

3: UP — wait, no:

39: LEVEL_UP_DEX

40: LEVEL_UP_STR

42: ENCHANT_BOW

In the list, TURN_DOWN is not directly listed. The actions are for movement and interaction.

The actions are:

1: LEFT

2: RIGHT

3: UP

4: DOWN

5: DO (interact)

So to change direction, I think I need to use the movement actions to turn, but in the context, the examples show turning with actions like TURN_DOWN.

In example 1, they said: "Action: 3 (TURN_DOWN)"

Similarly, in the description, it says: "Actions available" includes numbers, and in examples, they used 3 for TURN_DOWN.

In the initial problem: "Actions available: 0:NOOP,

Action: DO (unpatched)

Final Answer column:
**Action:** 5 (DO)
